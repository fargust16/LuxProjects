Мать, полуголая, в красной юбке, стоит на коленях, зачесывая длинные мягкие волосы отца со лба на затылок черной гребенкой, которой я любил перепиливать корки арбузов; мать непрерывно говорит что-то густым, хрипящим голосом, ее серые глаза опухли и словно тают, стекая крупными каплями слез.
Меня держит за руку бабушка, — круглая, большеголовая, с огромными глазами и смешным рыхлым носом; она вся черная, мягкая и удивительно интересная; она тоже плачет, как-то особенно и хорошо подпевая матери, дрожит вся и дергает меня, толкая к отцу; я упираюсь, прячусь за нее; мне боязно и неловко.
Я никогда еще не видал, чтобы большие плакали, и не понимал слов, неоднократно сказанных бабушкой:
— Попрощайся с тятей-то, никогда уж не увидишь его, помер он, голубчик, не в срок, не в свой час...
Я был тяжко болен, — только что встал на ноги; во время болезни, — я это хорошо помню, — отец весело возился со мною, потом он вдруг исчез, и его заменила бабушка, странный человек.
— Ты откуда пришла? — спросил я ее.
Она ответила:
— С верху, из Нижнего, да не пришла, а приехала! По воде-то не ходят, шиш!
Это было смешно и непонятно: наверху, в доме, жили бородатые крашеные персияне, а в подвале старый желтый калмык продавал овчины. По лестнице можно съехать верхом на перилах или, когда упадешь, скатиться кувырком, — это я знал хорошо. И при чем тут вода? Всё неверно и забавно спутано.
— А отчего я шиш?
— Оттого, что шумишь, — сказала она, тоже смеясь.
Она говорила ласково, весело, складно. Я с первого же дня подружился с нею, и теперь мне хочется, чтобы она скорее ушла со мною из этой комнаты.
Меня подавляет мать; ее слезы и вой зажгли во мне новое, тревожное чувство. Я впервые вижу ее такою, — она была всегда строгая, говорила мало; она чистая, гладкая и большая, как лошадь; у нее жесткое тело и страшно сильные руки. А сейчас она вся как-то неприятно вспухла и растрепана, всё на ней разорвалось; волосы, лежавшие на голове аккуратно, большою светлой шапкой, рассыпались по голому плечу, упали на лицо, а половина их, заплетенная в косу, болтается, задевая уснувшее отцово лицо. Я уже давно стою в комнате, но она ни разу не взглянула на меня, — причесывает отца и всё рычит, захлебываясь слезами.
В дверь заглядывают черные мужики и солдат-будочник. Он сердито кричит:
— Скорее убирайте!
Окно занавешено темной шалью; она вздувается, как парус. Однажды отец катал меня на лодке с парусом. Вдруг ударил гром. Отец засмеялся, крепко сжал меня коленями и крикнул:
— Ничего, не бойся, Лук!
Вдруг мать тяжело взметнулась с пола, тотчас снова осела, опрокинулась на спину, разметав волосы по полу; ее слепое, белое лицо посинело, и, оскалив зубы, как отец, она сказала страшным голосом:
— Дверь затворите... Алексея — вон!
Оттолкнув меня, бабушка бросилась к двери, закричала:
— Родимые, не бойтесь, не троньте, уйдите Христа ради! Это — не холера, роды пришли, помилуйте, батюшки!
Я спрятался в темный угол за сундук и оттуда смотрел, как мать извивается по полу, охая и скрипя зубами, а бабушка, ползая вокруг, говорит ласково и радостно:
— Во имя отца и сына! Потерпи, Варюша! Пресвятая мати божия, заступница...
Мне страшно; они возятся на полу около отца, задевают его, стонут и кричат, а он неподвижен и точно смеется. Это длилось долго — возня на полу; не однажды мать вставала на ноги и снова падала; бабушка выкатывалась из комнаты, как большой черный мягкий шар; потом вдруг во тьме закричал ребенок.
— Слава тебе, господи! — сказала бабушка. — Мальчик!
И зажгла свечу.
Я, должно быть, заснул в углу, — ничего не помню больше.
Второй оттиск в памяти моей — дождливый день, пустынный угол кладбища; я стою на скользком бугре липкой земли и смотрю в яму, куда опустили гроб отца; на дне ямы много воды и есть лягушки, — две уже взобрались на желтую крышку гроба.
У могилы — я, бабушка, мокрый будочник и двое сердитых мужиков с лопатами. Всех осыпает теплый дождь, мелкий, как бисер.
— Зарывай, — сказал будочник, отходя прочь.
Бабушка заплакала, спрятав лицо в конец головного платка. Мужики, согнувшись, торопливо начали сбрасывать землю в могилу, захлюпала вода; спрыгнув с гроба, лягушки стали бросаться на стенки ямы, комья земли сшибали их на дно.
— Отойди, Леня, — сказала бабушка, взяв меня за плечо; я выскользнул из-под ее руки, не хотелось уходить.
— Экой ты, господи, — пожаловалась бабушка, не то на меня, не то на бога, и долго стояла молча, опустив голову; уже могила сравнялась с землей, а она всё еще стоит.
Мужики гулко шлепали лопатами по земле; налетел ветер и прогнал, унес дождь. Бабушка взяла меня за руку и повела к далекой церкви, среди множества темных крестов.
— Ты что не поплачешь? — спросила она, когда вышла за ограду. — Поплакал бы!
— Не хочется, — сказал я.
— Ну, не хочется, так и не надо, — тихонько выговорила она.
Всё это было удивительно: я плакал редко и только от обиды, не от боли; отец всегда смеялся над моими слезами, а мать кричала:
— Не смей плакать!
Потом мы ехали по широкой, очень грязной улице на дрожках, среди темно-красных домов; я спросил бабушку:
— А лягушки не вылезут?
— Нет, уж не вылезут, — ответила она. — Бог с ними!
Ни отец, ни мать не произносили так часто и родственно имя божие.
 
Через несколько дней я, бабушка и мать ехали на пароходе, в маленькой каюте; новорожденный брат мой Максим умер и лежал на столе в углу, завернутый в белое, спеленатый красною тесьмой.
Примостившись на узлах и сундуках, я смотрю в окно, выпуклое и круглое, точно глаз коня; за мокрым стеклом бесконечно льется мутная, пенная вода. Порою она, вскидываясь, лижет стекло. Я невольно прыгаю на пол.
— Не бойся, — говорит бабушка и, легко приподняв меня мягкими руками, снова ставит на узлы.
Над водою — серый, мокрый туман; далеко где-то является темная земля и снова исчезает в тумане и воде. Всё вокруг трясется. Только мать, закинув руки за голову, стоит, прислонясь к стене, твердо и неподвижно. Лицо у нее темное, железное и слепое, глаза крепко закрыты, она всё время молчит, и вся какая-то другая, новая, даже платье на ней незнакомо мне.
Бабушка не однажды говорила ей тихо:
— Варя, ты бы поела чего, маленько, а?
Она молчит и неподвижна.
Бабушка говорит со мною шёпотом, а с матерью — громче, но как-то осторожно, робко и очень мало. Мне кажется, что она боится матери. Это понятно мне и очень сближает с бабушкой.
— Саратов, — неожиданно громко и сердито сказала мать. — Где же матрос?
Вот и слова у нее странные, чужие: Саратов, матрос.
Вошел широкий седой человек, одетый в синее, принес маленький ящик. Бабушка взяла его и стала укладывать тело брата, уложила и понесла к двери на вытянутых руках, но, — толстая, — она могла пройти в узенькую дверь каюты только боком и смешно замялась перед нею.
— Эх, мамаша, — крикнула мать, отняла у нее гроб, и обе они исчезли, а я остался в каюте, разглядывая синего мужика.
— Что, отошел братишка-то? — сказал он, наклонясь ко мне.
— Ты кто?
— Матрос.
— А Саратов — кто?
— Город. Гляди в окно, вот он!
За окном двигалась земля; темная, обрывистая, она курилась туманом, напоминая большой кусок хлеба, только что отрезанный от каравая.
— А куда бабушка ушла?
— Внука хоронить.
— Его в землю зароют?
— А как же? Зароют.
Я рассказал матросу, как зарыли живых лягушек, хороня отца. Он поднял меня на руки, тесно прижал к себе и поцеловал.
— Эх, брат, ничего ты еще не понимаешь! — сказал он. — Лягушек жалеть не надо, господь с ними! Мать пожалей, — вон как ее горе ушибло!
Над нами загудело, завыло. Я уже знал, что это — пароход, и не испугался, а матрос торопливо опустил меня на пол и бросился вон, говоря:
— Надо бежать!
И мне тоже захотелось убежать. Я вышел за дверь. В полутемной узкой щели было пусто. Недалеко от двери блестела медь на ступенях лестницы. Взглянув наверх, я увидал людей с котомками и узлами в руках. Было ясно, что все уходят с парохода, — значит, и мне нужно уходить.
Но когда вместе с толпою мужиков я очутился у борта парохода, перед мостками на берег, все стали кричать на меня:
— Это чей? Чей ты?
— Не знаю.
Меня долго толкали, встряхивали, щупали. Наконец явился седой матрос и схватил меня, объяснив:
— Это астраханский, из каюты...
Бегом он снес меня в каюту, сунул на узлы и ушел, грозя пальцем:
— Я тебе задам!
Шум над головою становился всё тише, пароход уже не дрожал и не бухал по воде. Окно каюты загородила какая-то мокрая стена; стало темно, душно, узлы точно распухли, стесняя меня, и всё было нехорошо. Может быть, меня так и оставят навсегда одного в пустом пароходе?
Подошел к двери. Она не отворяется, медную ручку ее нельзя повернуть. Взяв бутылку с молоком, я со всею силой ударил по ручке. Бутылка разбилась, молоко облило мне ноги, натекло в сапоги.
Огорченный неудачей, я лег на узлы, заплакал тихонько и, в слезах, уснул.
А когда проснулся, пароход снова бухал и дрожал, окно каюты горело, как солнце. Бабушка, сидя около меня, чесала волосы и морщилась, что-то нашептывая. Волос у нее было странно много, они густо покрывали ей плечи, грудь, колени и лежали на полу, черные, отливая синим. Приподнимая их с пола одною рукою и держа на весу, она с трудом вводила в толстые пряди деревянный редкозубый гребень; губы ее кривились, темные глаза сверкали сердито, а лицо в этой массе волос стало маленьким и смешным.
Сегодня она казалась злою, но когда я спросил, отчего у нее такие длинные волосы, она сказала вчерашним теплым и мягким голосом:
— Видно, в наказание господь дал, — расчеши-ка вот их, окаянные! Смолоду я гривой этой хвасталась, на старости кляну! А ты спи! Еще рано, — солнышко чуть только с ночи поднялось...
— Не хочу уж спать!
— Ну, ино не спи, — тотчас согласилась она, заплетая косу и поглядывая на диван, где вверх лицом, вытянувшись струною, лежала мать. — Как это ты вчера бутыль-то раскокал? Тихонько говори!
Говорила она, как-то особенно выпевая слова, и они легко укреплялись в памяти моей, похожие на цветы, такие же ласковые, яркие, сочные. Когда она улыбалась, ее темные, как вишни, зрачки расширялись, вспыхивая невыразимо приятным светом, улыбка весело обнажала белые крепкие зубы, и, несмотря на множество морщин в темной коже щек, всё лицо казалось молодым и светлым. Очень портил его этот рыхлый нос с раздутыми ноздрями и красный на конце. Она нюхала табак из черной табакерки, украшенной серебром. Вся она — темная, но светилась изнутри — через глаза — неугасимым, веселым и теплым светом. Она сутула, почти горбатая, очень полная, а двигалась легко и ловко, точно большая кошка, — она и мягкая такая же, как этот ласковый зверь.
До нее как будто спал я, спрятанный в темноте, но явилась она, разбудила, вывела на свет, связала всё вокруг меня в непрерывную нить, сплела всё в разноцветное кружево и сразу стала на всю жизнь другом, самым близким сердцу моему, самым понятным и дорогим человеком, — это ее бескорыстная любовь к миру обогатила меня, насытив крепкой силой для трудной жизни.
 
Сорок лет назад пароходы плавали медленно; мы ехали до Нижнего очень долго, и я хорошо помню эти первые дни насыщения красотою.
Установилась хорошая погода; с утра до вечера я с бабушкой на палубе, под ясным небом, между позолоченных осенью, шелками шитых берегов Волги. Не торопясь, лениво и гулко бухая плицами по серовато-синей воде, тянется вверх по течению светло-рыжий пароход, с баржой на длинном буксире. Баржа серая и похожа на мокрицу. Незаметно плывет над Волгой солнце; каждый час всё вокруг ново, всё меняется; зеленые горы — как пышные складки на богатой одежде земли; по берегам стоят города и села, точно пряничные издали; золотой осенний лист плывет по воде.
— Ты гляди, как хорошо-то! — ежеминутно говорит бабушка, переходя от борта к борту, и вся сияет, а глаза у нее радостно расширены.
Часто она, заглядевшись на берег, забывала обо мне: стоит у борта, сложив руки на груди, улыбается и молчит, а на глазах слезы. Я дергаю ее за темную, с набойкой цветами, юбку.
— Ась? — встрепенется она. — А я будто задремала да сон вижу.
— А о чем плачешь?
— Это, милый, от радости да от старости, — говорит она, улыбаясь. — Я ведь уж старая, за шестой десяток лета-вёсны мои перекинулись-пошли.
И, понюхав табаку, начинает рассказывать мне какие-то диковинные истории о добрых разбойниках, о святых людях, о всяком зверье и нечистой силе.
Сказки она сказывает тихо, таинственно, наклонясь к моему лицу, заглядывая в глаза мне расширенными зрачками, точно вливая в сердце мое силу, приподнимающую меня. Говорит, точно поет, и чем дальше, тем складней звучат слова. Слушать ее невыразимо приятно. Я слушаю и прошу:
— Еще!
— А еще вот как было: сидит в подпечке старичок домовой, занозил он себе лапу лапшой, качается, хныкает: «Ой, мышеньки, больно, ой, мышата, не стерплю!»
Подняв ногу, она хватается за нее руками, качает ее на весу и смешно морщит лицо, словно ей самой больно.
Вокруг стоят матросы — бородатые ласковые мужики, — слушают, смеются, хвалят ее и тоже просят:
— А ну, бабушка, расскажи еще чего!
Потом говорят:
— Айда ужинать с нами!
За ужином они угощают ее водкой, меня — арбузами, дыней; это делается скрытно: на пароходе едет человек, который запрещает есть фрукты, отнимает их и выбрасывает в реку. Он одет похоже на будочника — с медными пуговицами — и всегда пьяный; люди прячутся от него.
Мать редко выходит на палубу и держится в стороне от нас. Она всё молчит, мать. Ее большое стройное тело, темное, железное лицо, тяжелая корона заплетенных в косы светлых волос, — вся она мощная и твердая, — вспоминаются мне как бы сквозь туман или прозрачное облако; из него отдаленно и неприветливо смотрят прямые серые глаза, такие же большие, как у бабушки.
Однажды она строго сказала:
— Смеются люди над вами, мамаша!
— А господь с ними! — беззаботно ответила бабушка. — А пускай смеются, на доброе им здоровье!
Помню детскую радость бабушки при виде Нижнего. Дергая за руку, она толкала меня к борту и кричала:
— Гляди, гляди, как хорошо! Вот он, батюшка, Нижний-то! Вот он какой, богов! Церкви-те, гляди-ка ты, летят будто!
И просила мать, чуть не плача:
— Варюша, погляди, чай, а? Поди, забыла ведь! Порадуйся!
Мать хмуро улыбалась.
Когда пароход остановился против красивого города, среди реки, тесно загроможденной судами, ощетинившейся сотнями острых мачт, к борту его подплыла большая лодка со множеством людей, подцепилась багром к спущенному трапу, и один за другим люди из лодки стали подниматься на палубу. Впереди всех быстро шел небольшой сухонький старичок, в черном длинном одеянии, с рыжей, как золото, бородкой, с птичьим носом и зелеными глазками.
— Папаша! — густо и громко крикнула мать и опрокинулась на него, а он, хватая ее за голову, быстро гладя щеки ее маленькими красными руками, кричал, взвизгивая:
— Что-о, дура? Ага-а! То-то вот... Эх вы-и...
Бабушка обнимала и целовала как-то сразу всех, вертясь, как винт; она толкала меня к людям и говорила торопливо:
— Ну, скорее! Это — дядя Михайло, это — Яков... Тетка Наталья, это — братья, оба Саши, сестра Катерина, это всё наше племя, вот сколько!
Дедушка сказал ей:
— Здорова ли, мать?
Они троекратно поцеловались.
Дед выдернул меня из тесной кучи людей и спросил, держа за голову:
— Ты чей таков будешь?
— Астраханский, из каюты...
— Чего он говорит? — обратился дед к матери и, не дождавшись ответа, отодвинул меня, сказав:
— Скулы-те отцовы... Слезайте в лодку!
Съехали на берег и толпой пошли в гору, по съезду, мощенному крупным булыжником, между двух высоких откосов, покрытых жухлой, примятой травой.
Дед с матерью шли впереди всех. Он был ростом под руку ей, шагал мелко и быстро, а она, глядя на него сверху вниз, точно по воздуху плыла. За ними молча двигались дядья: черный гладковолосый Михаил, сухой, как дед; светлый и кудрявый Яков, какие-то толстые женщины в ярких платьях и человек шесть детей, все старше меня и все тихие. Я шел с бабушкой и маленькой теткой Натальей. Бледная, голубоглазая, с огромным животом, она часто останавливалась и, задыхаясь, шептала:
— Ой, не могу!
— Нашто они тревожили тебя? — сердито ворчала бабушка. — Эко неумное племя!
И взрослые и дети — все не понравились мне, я чувствовал себя чужим среди них, даже и бабушка как-то померкла, отдалилась.
Особенно же не понравился мне дед; я сразу почуял в нем врага, и у меня явилось особенное внимание к нему, опасливое любопытство.
Дошли до конца съезда. На самом верху его, прислонясь к правому откосу и начиная собою улицу, стоял приземистый одноэтажный дом, окрашенный грязно-розовой краской, с нахлобученной низкой крышей и выпученными окнами. С улицы он показался мне большим, но внутри его, в маленьких полутемных комнатах, было тесно; везде, как на пароходе перед пристанью, суетились сердитые люди, стаей вороватых воробьев метались ребятишки, и всюду стоял едкий, незнакомый запах.', 'https://d1w7fb2mkkr3kw.cloudfront.net/assets/images/book/lrg/9781/3326/9781332600700.jpg', '{comedy,fantastic,adventure}', 20, 'Горький начинает рассказ с того, как от холеры в Астрахани умирает его отец, Максим Пешков, а следом за ним его новорожденный брат.

abandoned church. The roof had fallen in long ago, and an enormous sycamore had

grown on the spot where the sacristy had once stood.

He decided to spend the night there. He saw to it that all the sheep entered through the

ruined gate, and then laid some planks across it to prevent the flock from wandering

away during the night. There were no wolves in the region, but once an animal had

strayed during the night, and the boy had had to spend the entire next day searching

for it.

He swept the floor with his jacket and lay down, using the book he had just finished

reading as a pillow. He told himself that he would have to start reading thicker books:

they lasted longer, and made more comfortable pillows.

It was still dark when he awoke, and, looking up, he could see the stars through the

half-destroyed roof.

I wanted to sleep a little longer, he thought. He had had the same dream that night as a

week ago, and once again he had awakened before it ended.

He arose and, taking up his crook, began to awaken the sheep that still slept. He had

noticed that, as soon as he awoke, most of his animals also began to stir. It was as if

some mysterious energy bound his life to that of the sheep, with whom he had spent

the past two years, leading them through the countryside in search of food and water.

"They are so used to me that they know my schedule," he muttered. Thinking about

that for a moment, he realized that it could be the other way around: that it was he

who had become accustomed to their schedule.

But there were certain of them who took a bit longer to awaken. The boy prodded

them, one by one, with his crook, calling each by name. He had always believed that

the sheep were able to understand what he said. So there were times when he read

them parts of his books that had made an impression on him, or when he would tell

them of the loneliness or the happiness of a shepherd in the fields. Sometimes he

would comment to them on the things he had seen in the villages they passed.

But for the past few days he had spoken to them about only one thing: the girl, the

daughter of a merchant who lived in the village they would reach in about four days.

He had been to the village only once, the year before. The merchant was the

proprietor of a dry goods shop, and he always demanded that the sheep be sheared in

his presence, so that he would not be cheated. A friend had told the boy about the

shop, and he had taken his sheep there.

*

"I need to sell some wool," the boy told the merchant.

The shop was busy, and the man asked the shepherd to wait until the afternoon. So the

boy sat on the steps of the shop and took a book from his bag.

"I didn''t know shepherds knew how to read," said a girl''s voice behind him.

The girl was typical of the region of Andalusia, with flowing black hair, and eyes that

vaguely recalled the Moorish conquerors.

"Well, usually I learn more from my sheep than from books," he answered. During the

two hours that they talked, she told him she was the merchant''s daughter, and spoke of

life in the village, where each day was like all the others. The shepherd told her of the

Andalusian countryside, and related the news from the other towns where he had
stopped. It was a pleasant change from talking to his sheep.

"How did you learn to read?" the girl asked at one point.

"Like everybody learns," he said. "In school."

"Well, if you know how to read, why are you just a shepherd?"

The boy mumbled an answer that allowed him to avoid responding to her question.

He was sure the girl would never understand. He went on telling stories about his

travels, and her bright, Moorish eyes went wide with fear and surprise. As the time

passed, the boy found himself wishing that the day would never end, that her father

would stay busy and keep him waiting for three days. He recognized that he was

feeling something he had never experienced before: the desire to live in one place

forever. With the girl with the raven hair, his days would never be the same again.

But finally the merchant appeared, and asked the boy to shear four sheep. He paid for

the wool and asked the shepherd to come back the following year.

*

And now it was only four days before he would be back in that same village. He was

excited, and at the same time uneasy: maybe the girl had already forgotten him. Lots

of shepherds passed through, selling their wool.

"It doesn''t matter," he said to his sheep. "I know other girls in other places."

But in his heart he knew that it did matter. And he knew that shepherds, like seamen

and like traveling salesmen, always found a town where there was someone who

could make them forget the joys of carefree wandering.

The day was dawning, and the shepherd urged his sheep in the direction of the sun.

They never have to make any decisions, he thought. Maybe that''s why they always

stay close to me.

The only things that concerned the sheep were food and water. As long as the boy

knew how to find the best pastures in Andalusia, they would be his friends. Yes, their

days were all the same, with the seemingly endless hours between sunrise and dusk;

and they had never read a book in their young lives, and didn''t understand when the

boy told them about the sights of the cities. They were content with just food and

water, and, in exchange, they generously gave of their wool, their company, and--

once in a while--their meat.

If I became a monster today, and decided to kill them, one by one, they would become

aware only after most of the flock had been slaughtered, thought the boy. They trust

me, and they''ve forgotten how to rely on their own instincts, because I lead them to

nourishment.

The boy was surprised at his thoughts. Maybe the church, with the sycamore growing

from within, had been haunted. It had caused him to have the same dream for a

second time, and it was causing him to feel anger toward his faithful companions. He

drank a bit from the wine that remained from his dinner of the night before, and he

gathered his jacket closer to his body. He knew that a few hours from now, with the

sun at its zenith, the heat would be so great that he would not be able to lead his flock

across the fields. It was the time of day when all of Spain slept during the summer.

The heat lasted until nightfall, and all that time he had to carry his jacket. But when he

thought to complain about the burden of its weight, he remembered that, because he

had the jacket, he had withstood the cold of the dawn.

We have to be prepared for change, he thought, and he was grateful for the jacket''s

weight and warmth.

The jacket had a purpose, and so did the boy. His purpose in life was to travel.', 'https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1442866592l/9276509.jpg', '{adventure,funny,prose}', 22, 'The horizon was tinged with red, and suddenly the sun appeared. The boy thought back to that 
conversation with his father, and felt happy; he had already seen many castles and met many women (but 
none the equal of the one who awaited him several days hence). He owned a jacket, a book that he 
could trade for another, and a flock of sheep. But, most important, he was able every day to live out his 
dream. If he were to tire of the Andalusian fields, he could sell his sheep and go to sea. By the time he

The hottest day of the summer so far was drawing to a close and a drowsy silence lay over the large, square houses of Privet Drive. Cars that were usually gleaming stood dusty in their drives and lawns that were once emerald green lay parched and yellowing - ''for the use of hosepipes had been banned due to drought. Deprived of their usual car-washing and lawn-mowing pursuits, the inhabitants of Privet Drive had retreated into the shade of their cool houses, windows thrown wide in the hope of tempting in a nonexistent breeze. The only person left outdoors was a teenage boy who was lying flat on his back in a flowerbed outside number four. 
He was a skinny, black-haired, bespectacled boy who had the pinched, slightly unhealthy look of someone who has grown a lot in a short space of time. His jeans were torn and dirty, his T-shirt baggy and faded, and the soles of his trainers were peeling away from the uppers. Harry Potters appearance did not endear him to the neighbours, who were the sort of people who thought scruffiness ought to be punishable by law, but as he had hidden himself behind a large hydrangea bush this evening he was quite invisible to passers-by. In fact, the only way he would be spotted was if his Uncle Vernon or Aunt Petunia stuck their heads out of the living-room window and looked straight down into the flowerbed below. 
On the whole, Harry thought he was to be congratulated on his idea of hiding here. He was not, perhaps, very comfortable lying on the hot, hard earth but, on the other hand, nobody was glaring at him, grinding their teeth so loudly that he could not hear the news, or shooting nasty questions at him, as had happened every time he had tried sitting down in the living room to watch television with his aunt and uncle. 
Almost as though this thought had fluttered through the open window, Vernon Dursley, Harry''s uncle, suddenly spoke.
''Glad to see the boy''s stopped trying to butt in. Where is he, anyway?'' 
''I don''t know,'' said Aunt Petunia, unconcerned. ''Not in the house.'' 
Uncle Vernon grunted. 
''Watching the news . . .'' he said scathingly. ''I''d like to know what he''s really up to. As if a normal boy cares what''s on the news - ''Dudley hasn''t got a clue what''s going on; doubt he knows who the Prime Minister is! Anyway, it''s not as if there''d be anything about his lot on our news - '' 
''Vernon, shh!'' said Aunt Petunia. The window''s open!'' 
''Oh - yes - sorry, dear.'' 
The Dursleys fell silent. Harry listened to a jingle about Fruit ''n'' Bran breakfast cereal while he watched Mrs Figg, a batty cat-loving old lady from nearby Wisteria Walk, amble slowly past. She was frowning and muttering to herself. Harry was very pleased he was concealed behind the bush, as Mrs Figg had recently taken to asking him round for tea whenever she met him in the street. She had rounded the corner and vanished from view before Uncle Vernon''s voice floated out of the window again. 
''Dudders out for tea?'' 
''At the Polkisses'','' said Aunt Petunia fondly. ''He''s got so many little friends, he''s so popular . . .'' 
Harry suppressed a snort with difficulty. The Dursleys really were astonishingly stupid about their son, Dudley. They had swallowed all his dim-witted lies about having tea with a different member of his gang every night of the summer holidays. Harry knew perfectly well that Dudley had not been to tea anywhere; he and his gang spent every evening vandalising the play park, smoking on street corners and throwing stones at passing cars and children. Harry had seen them at it during his evening walks around Little Whinging; he had spent most of the holidays wandering the streets, scavenging newspapers from bins along the way. 
The opening notes of the music that heralded the seven o''clock news reached Harry''s ears and his stomach turned over. Perhaps tonight - after a month of waiting - would be the night. 
''Record numbers of stranded holidaymakers fill airports as the Spanish baggage-handlers'' strike reaches its second week - '' 
''Give ''em a lifelong siesta, I would,'' snarled Uncle Vernon over the end of the newsreaders sentence, but no matter: outside in the flowerbed, Harry''s stomach seemed to unclench. If anything had happened, it would surely have been the first item on the news; death and destruction were more important than stranded holidaymakers. 
He let out a long, slow breath and stared up at the brilliant blue sky. Every day this summer had been the same: the tension, the expectation, the temporary relief, and then mounting tension again . . . and always, growing more insistent all the time, the question of why nothing had happened yet. 
He kept listening, just in case there was some small clue, not recognised for what it really was by the Muggles - an unexplained disappearance, perhaps, or some strange accident . . . but the baggage-handlers'' strike was followed by news about the drought in the Southeast (''I hope he''s listening next door!'' bellowed Uncle Vernon. ''Him with his sprinklers on at three in the morning!''), then a helicopter that had almost crashed in a field in Surrey, then a famous actress''s divorce from her famous husband (''As if we''re interested in their sordid affairs,'' sniffed Aunt Petunia, who had followed the case obsessively in every magazine she could lay her bony hands on). 
Harry closed his eyes against the now blazing evening sky as the newsreader said, ''- and finally, Bungy the budgie has found a novel way of keeping cool this summer. Bungy, who lives at the Five Feathers in Barnsley, has learned to water ski! Mary Dorkins went to find out more.'' 
Harry opened his eyes. If they had reached water-skiing budgerigars, there would be nothing else worth hearing. He rolled cautiously on to his front and raised himself on to his knees and elbows, preparing to crawl out from under the window. 
He had moved about two inches when several things happened in very quick succession. 
A loud, echoing crack broke the sleepy silence like a gunshot; a cat streaked out from under a parked car and flew out of sight; a shriek, a bellowed oath and the sound of breaking china came from the Dursleys'' living room, and as though this was the signal Harry had been waiting for he jumped to his feet, at the same time pulling from the waistband of his jeans a thin wooden wand as if he were unsheathing a sword - but before he could draw himself up to full height, the top of his head collided with the Dursleys'' open window. The resultant crash made Aunt Petunia scream even louder. 
Harry felt as though his head had been split in two. Eyes streaming, he swayed, trying to focus on the street to spot the source of the noise, but he had barely staggered upright when two large purple hands reached through the open window and closed tightly around his throat. 
''Put - it - away!'' Uncle Vernon snarled into Harry''s ear. ''Now! Before - anyone - sees!'' 
''Get - off - me!'' Harry gasped. For a few seconds they struggled, Harry pulling at his uncle''s sausage-like fingers with his left hand, his right maintaining a firm grip on his raised wand; then, as the pain in the top of Harry''s head gave a particularly nasty throb, Uncle Vernon yelped and released Harry as though he had received an electric shock. Some invisible force seemed to have surged through his nephew, making him impossible to hold. 
Panting, Harry fell forwards over the hydrangea bush, straightened up and stared around. There was no sign of what had caused the loud cracking noise, but there were several faces peering through various nearby windows. Harry stuffed his wand hastily back into his jeans and tried to look innocent. 
''Lovely evening!'' shouted Uncle Vernon, waving at Mrs Number Seven opposite, who was glaring from behind her net curtains. ''Did you hear that car backfire just now? Gave Petunia and me quite a turn!'' 
He continued to grin in a horrible, manic way until all the curious neighbours had disappeared from their various windows, then the grin became a grimace of rage as he beckoned Harry back towards him. 
Harry moved a few steps closer, taking care to stop just short of the point at which Uncle Vernon''s outstretched hands could resume their strangling. 
''What the devil do you mean by it, boy?'' asked Uncle Vernon in a croaky voice that trembled with fury. 
''What do I mean by what?'' said Harry coldly. He kept looking left and right up the street, still hoping to see the person who had made the cracking noise. 
''Making a racket like a starting pistol right outside our - '' 
''I didn''t make that noise,'' said Harry firmly. 
Aunt Petunia''s thin, horsy face now appeared beside Uncle Vernon''s wide, purple one. She looked livid. 
''Why were you lurking under our window?'' 
''Yes - yes, good point, Petunia! What were you doing under our window, boy?'' 
''Listening to the news,'' said Harry in a resigned voice. 
His aunt and uncle exchanged looks of outrage. 
''Listening to the news! Again?'' 
''Well, it changes every day, you see,'' said Harry. 
''Don''t you be clever with me, boy! I want to know what you''re really up to - and don''t give me any more of this listening to the news tosh! You know perfectly well that your lot - '' 
''Careful, Vernon!'' breathed Aunt Petunia, and Uncle Vernon lowered his voice so that Harry could barely hear him,'' - that your lot don''t get on our news!'' 
That''s all you know,'' said Harry. 
The Dursleys goggled at him for a few seconds, then Aunt Petunia said, ''You''re a nasty little liar. What are all those - '' she, too, lowered her voice so that Harry had to lip-read the next word, '' - owls doing if they''re not bringing you news?''
''Aha!'' said Uncle Vernon in a triumphant whisper. ''Get out of that one, boy! As if we didn''t know you get all your news from those pestilential birds!'' 
Harry hesitated for a moment. It cost him something to tell the truth this time, even though his aunt and uncle could not possibly know how bad he felt at admitting it. 
''The owls . . . aren''t bringing me news,'' he said tonelessly. 
''I don''t believe it,'' said Aunt Petunia at once. 
''No more do I,'' said Uncle Vernon forcefully. 
''We know you''re up to something funny'' said Aunt Petunia. 
''We''re not stupid, you know,'' said Uncle Vernon. 
''Well, that''s news to me,'' said Harry, his temper rising, and before the Dursleys could call him back, he had wheeled about, crossed the front lawn, stepped over the low garden wall and was striding off up the street. 
He was in trouble now and he knew it. He would have to face his aunt and uncle later and pay the price for his rudeness, but he: did not care very much just at the moment; he had much more pressing matters on his mind. 
Harry was sure the cracking noise had been made by someone Apparating or Disapparating. It was exactly the sound Dobby the house-elf made when he vanished into thin air. Was it possible that Dobby was here in Privet Drive? Could Dobby be following him right at this very moment? As this thought occurred he wheeled around and stared back down Privet Drive, but it appeared to be completely deserted and Harry was sure that Dobby did not know how to become invisible. 
He walked on, hardly aware of the route he was taking, for he had pounded these streets so often lately that his feet carried him to his favourite haunts automatically. Every few steps he glanced back over his shoulder. Someone magical had been near him as he lay among Aunt Petunia''s dying begonias, he was sure of it. Why hadn''t they spoken to him, why hadn''t they made contact, why were they hiding now? 
And then, as his feeling of frustration peaked, his certainty leaked away. 
Perhaps it hadn''t been a magical sound after all. Perhaps he was so desperate for the tiniest sign of contact from the world to which he belonged that he was simply overreacting to perfectly ordinary noises. Could he be sure it hadn''t been the sound of something breaking inside a neighbour''s house? 
Harry felt a dull, sinking sensation in his stomach and before he knew it the feeling of hopelessness that had plagued him all summer rolled over him once again. 
Tomorrow morning he would be woken by the alarm at five o''clock so he could pay the owl that delivered the Daily Prophet - but was there any point continuing to take it? Harry merely glanced at the front page before throwing it aside these days; when the idiots who ran the paper finally realised that Voldemort was back it would be headline news, and that was the only kind Harry cared about. 
If he was lucky, there would also be owls carrying letters from his best friends Ron and Hermione, though any expectation he''d had that their letters would bring him news had long since been dashed. 
We can''t say much about you-know-what, obviously . . . We''ve been told not to say anything important in case our letters go astray . . . We''re quite busy but I can''t give you details here . . . There''s a fair amount going on, we''ll tell you everything when we see you . . . 
But when were they going to see him? Nobody seemed too bothered with a precise date. Hermione had scribbled I expect we''ll be seeing you quite soon inside his birthday card, but how soon was soon? As far as Harry could tell from the vague hints in their letters, Hermione and Ron were in the same place, presumably at Ron''s parents'' house. He could hardly bear to think of the pair of them having fun at The Burrow when he was stuck in Privet Drive. In fact, he was so angry with them he had thrown away, unopened, the two boxes of Honeydukes chocolates they''d sent him for his birthday. He''d regretted it later, after the wilted salad Aunt Petunia had provided for dinner that night. 
And what were Ron and Hermione busy with? Why wasn''t he, Harry, busy? Hadn''t he proved himself capable of handling much more than them? Had they all forgotten what he had done? Hadn''t it been he who had entered that graveyard and watched Cedric being murdered, and been tied to that tombstone and nearly killed? 
Don''t think about that, Harry told himself sternly for the hundredth time that summer. It was bad enough that he kept revisiting the graveyard in his nightmares, without dwelling on it in his waking moments too. 
He turned a corner into Magnolia Crescent; halfway along he passed the narrow alleyway down the side of a garage where he had first clapped eyes on his godfather. Sirius, at least, seemed to understand how Harry was feeling. Admittedly, his letters were just as empty of proper news as Ron and Hermione''s, but at least they contained words of caution and consolation instead of tantalising hints: I know this must be frustrating for you . . . Keep your nose clean and everything will be OK . . .Be careful and don''t do anything rash . . . 
Well, thought Harry, as he crossed Magnolia Crescent, turned into Magnolia Road and headed towards the darkening play park, he had (by and large) done as Sirius advised. He had at least resisted the temptation to tie his trunk to his broomstick and set off for The Burrow by himself. In fact, Harry thought his behaviour had been very good considering how frustrated and angry he felt at being stuck in Privet Drive so long, reduced to hiding in flowerbeds in the hope of hearing something that might point to what Lord Voldemort was doing. Nevertheless, it was quite galling to be told not to be rash by a man who had served twelve years in the wizard prison, Azkaban, escaped, attempted to commit the murder he had been convicted for in the first place, then gone on the run with a stolen Hippogriff. 
Harry vaulted over the locked park gate and set off across the parched grass. The park was as empty as the surrounding streets. When he reached the swings he sank on to the only one that Dudley and his friends had not yet managed to break, coiled one arm around the chain and stared moodily at the ground. He would not be able to hide in the Dursleys'' flowerbed again. Tomorrow, he would have to think of some fresh way of listening to the news. In the meantime, he had nothing to look forward to but another restless, disturbed night, because even when he escaped the nightmares about Cedric he had unsettling dreams about long dark corridors, all finishing in dead ends and locked doors, which he supposed had something to do with the trapped feeling he had when he was awake. Often the old scar on his forehead prickled uncomfortably, but he did not fool himself that Ron or Hermione or Sirius would find that very interesting any more. In the past, his scar hurting had warned that Voldemort was getting stronger again, but now that Voldemort was back they would probably remind him that its regular irritation was only to be expected . . . nothing to worry about . . . old news . . . 
The injustice of it all welled up inside him so that he wanted to yell with fury. If it hadn''t been for him, nobody would even have known Voldemort was back! And. his reward was to be stuck in Little Whinging for four solid weeks, completely cut off from the magical world, reduced to squatting among dying begonias so hat he could hear about water-skiing budgerigars! How could Dumbledore have forgotten him so easily? Why had Ron and Hermione got together without inviting him along, too? How much longer was he supposed to endure Sirius telling him to sit tight and be a good boy; or resist the temptation to write to the stupid Daily Prophet and point out that Voldemort had returned? These curious thoughts whirled around in Harry''s head, and his insides writhed with anger as a sultry, velvety night fell around him, the air full of the smell of warm, dry grass, and the only sound that of the low grumble of traffic on the road beyond the park railings. He did not know how long he had sat on the swing before the sound of voices interrupted his musings and he looked up. The streetlamps from the surrounding roads were casting a misty glow strong enough to silhouette a group of people making their way across the park. One of them was singing a loud, crude song. The others were laughing. A soft ticking noise came from several expensive racing bikes that they were wheeling along. 
Harry knew who those people were. The figure in front was unmistakeably his cousin, Dudley Dursley wending his way home, accompanied by his faithful gang. 
Dudley was as vast as ever, but a year''s hard dieting and the discovery of a new talent had wrought quite a change in his physique. As Uncle Vernon delightedly told anyone who would listen, Dudley had recently become the Junior Heavyweight Inter-school Boxing Champion of the Southeast. ''The noble sport'', as Uncle Vernon called it, had made Dudley even more formidable than he had seemed to Harry in their primary school days when he had served as Dudley''s first punchball. Harry was not remotely afraid of his cousin any more but he still didn''t think that Dudley earning to punch harder and more accurately was cause for celebration. Neighbourhood children all around were terrified of him - even more terrified than they were of ''that Potter boy'' who, they lad been warned, was a hardened hooligan and attended St Brutus''s secure Centre for Incurably Criminal Boys. 
Harry watched the dark figures crossing the grass and wondered who they had been beating up tonight. Look round, Harry found himself thinking as he watched them. Come on . . . look round . . . I''m sitting here all alone . . . come and have a go . . . 
If Dudley''s friends saw him sitting here, they would be sure to make a beeline for him, and what would Dudley do then? He wouldn''t want to lose face in front of the gang, but he''d be terrified of provoking Harry . . . it would be really fun to watch Dudley''s dilemma, to taunt him, watch him, with him powerless to respond . . . and if any of the others tried hitting Harry, he was ready - he had his wand. Let them try . . . he''d love to vent some of his frustration on the boys who had once made his life hell. 
But they didn''t turn around, they didn''t see him, they were almost at the railings. Harry mastered the impulse to call after them . . . seeking a fight was not a smart move . . . he must not use magic he would be risking expulsion again. 
The voices of Dudley''s gang died away; they were out of sight, heading along Magnolia Road. 
There you go, Sirius, Harry thought dully. Nothing rash. Kept my nose clean. Exactly the opposite of what you''d have done. 
He got to his feet and stretched. Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon seemed to feel that whenever Dudley turned up was the right time to be home, and any time after that was much too late. Uncle Vernon had threatened to lock Harry in the shed if he came home alter Dudley ever again, so, stifling a yawn, and still scowling, Harry set off towards the park gate. 
Magnolia Road, like Privet Drive, was full of large, square houses with perfectly manicured lawns, all owned by large, square owners who drove very clean cars similar to Uncle Vernon''s. Harry preferred Little Whinging by night, when the curtained windows made patches of jewel-bright colour in the darkness and he ran no danger of hearing disapproving mutters about his ''delinquent'' appearance when he passed the householders. He walked quickly, so that halfway along Magnolia Road Dudley''s gang came into view again; they were saying their farewells at the entrance to Magnolia Crescent. Harry stepped into the shadow of a large lilac tree and waited. 
''. . . squealed like a pig, didn''t he?'' Malcolm was saying, to guffaws from the others. 
''Nice right hook, Big D,'' said Piers. 
''Same time tomorrow?'' said Dudley. 
''Round at my place, my parents will be out,'' said Gordon. 
''See you then,'' said Dudley. 
''Bye, Dud!'' 
''See ya, Big D!'' 
Harry waited for the rest of the gang to move on before setting off again. When their voices had faded once more he headed around the corner into Magnolia Crescent and by walking very quickly he soon came within hailing distance of Dudley, who was strolling along at his ease, humming tunelessly. 
''Hey, Big D!'' 
Dudley turned. 
''Oh,'' he grunted. ''It''s you.'' 
''How long have you been "Big D" then?'' said Harry. 
''Shut it,'' snarled Dudley, turning away. 
''Cool name,'' said Harry, grinning and falling into step beside is cousin. ''But you''ll always be "Ickle Diddykins" to me.'' 
''I said, SHUT IT!'' said Dudley, whose ham-like hands had curled into fists. 
''Don''t the boys know that''s what your mum calls you?'' 
''Shut your face.'' 
''You don''t tell her to shut her face. What about "Popkin" and "Dinky Diddydums", can I use them then?'' 
Dudley said nothing. The effort of keeping himself from hitting Harry seemed to demand all his self-control. 
''So who''ve you been beating up tonight?'' Harry asked, his grin fading. ''Another ten-year-old? I know you did Mark Evans two nights ago - '' 
''He was asking for it,'' snarled Dudley. 
''Oh yeah?'' 
''He cheeked me.'' 
''Yeah? Did he say you look like a pig that''s been taught to walk on its hind legs? ''Cause that''s not cheek, Dud, that''s true.'' 
A muscle was twitching in Dudley''s jaw. It gave Harry enormous satisfaction to know how furious he was making Dudley; he felt as though he was siphoning off his own frustration into his cousin, the only outlet he had. 
They turned right down the narrow alleyway where Harry had first seen Sirius and which formed a short cut between Magnolia Crescent and Wisteria Walk. It was empty and much darker than the streets it linked because there were no streetlamps. Their footsteps were muffled between garage walls on one side and a high fence on the other. 
Think you''re a big man carrying that thing, don''t you?'' Dudley said after a few seconds. 
''What thing?'' 
That - that thing you are hiding.'' 
Harry grinned again. 
''Not as stupid as you look, are you, Dud? But I s''pose, if you were, you wouldn''t be able to walk and talk at the same time.'' 
Harry pulled out his wand. He saw Dudley look sideways at it. 
''You''re not allowed,'' Dudley said at once. ''I know you''re not. You''d get expelled from that freak school you go to.'' 
''How d''you know they haven''t changed the rules, Big D?'' 
They haven''t,'' said Dudley, though he didn''t sound completely convinced. 
Harry laughed softly. 
''You haven''t got the guts to take me on without that thing, have you?'' Dudley snarled. 
''Whereas you just need four mates behind you before you can beat up a ten year old. You know that boxing title you keep banging on about? How old was your opponent? Seven? Eight?'' 
''He was sixteen, for your information,'' snarled Dudley, ''and he was out cold for twenty minutes after I''d finished with him and he was twice as heavy as you. You just wait till I tell Dad you had that thing out - 
''Running to Daddy now, are you? Is his ickle boxing champ frightened of nasty Harry''s wand?'' 
''Not this brave at night, are you?'' sneered Dudley. 
''This is night, Diddykins. That''s what we call it when it goes all dark like this.'' 
''I mean when you''re in bed!'' Dudley snarled. 
He had stopped walking. Harry stopped too, staring at his cousin. 
From the little he could see of Dudley''s large face, he was wearing a strangely triumphant look. 
''What d''you mean, I''m not brave when I''m in bed?'' said Harry, Completely nonplussed. ''What am I supposed to be frightened of, pillows or something?'' 
''I heard you last night,'' said Dudley breathlessly. Talking in your sleep. Moaning.'' 
''What d''you mean?'' Harry said again, but there was a cold, plunging sensation in his stomach. He had revisited the graveyard last night in his dreams. 
Dudley gave a harsh bark of laughter, then adopted a high-pitched whimpering voice. 
'' "Don''t kill Cedric! Don''t kill Cedric!" Who''s Cedric - your boyfriend?'' 
''I - you''re lying,'' said Harry automatically. But his mouth had gone dry. He knew Dudley wasn''t lying - how else would he know about Cedric? 
'' "Dad! Help me, Dad! He''s going to kill me, Dad! Boo hoo!'''' '' 
''Shut up,'' said Harry quietly. ''Shut up, Dudley, I''m warning you!'' 
'' "Come and help me, Dad! Mum, come and help me! He''s killed Cedric! Dad, help me! He''s going to - " Don''t you point that thing at me!'' 
Dudley backed into the alley wall. Harry was pointing the wand directly at Dudley''s heart. Harry could feel fourteen years'' hatred of Dudley pounding in his veins - what wouldn''t he give to strike now, to jinx Dudley so thoroughly he''d have to crawl home like an insect, struck dumb, sprouting feelers . . . 
''Don''t ever talk about that again,'' Harry snarled. ''D''you understand me?'' 
''Point that thing somewhere else!'' 
''I said, do you understand me?'' 
''Point it somewhere else!'' 
''DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME?'' 
''GET THAT THING AWAY FROM - '' 
Dudley gave an odd. shuddering gasp, as though he had been doused in icy water. 
Something had happened to the night. The star-strewn indigo sky was suddenly pitch black and lightless - the stars, the moon, the misty streetlamps at either end of the alley had vanished. The distant rumble of cars and the whisper of trees had gone. The balmy evening was suddenly piercingly, bitingly cold. They were surrounded by total, impenetrable, silent darkness, as though some giant hand had dropped a thick, icy mantle over the entire alleyway, blinding them. 
For a split second Harry thought he had done magic without meaning to, despite the fact that he''d been resisting as hard as he could - then his reason caught up with his senses - he didn''t have the power to turn off the stars. He turned his head this way and that, trying to see something, but the darkness pressed on his eyes like a weightless veil. 
Dudley''s terrified voice broke in Harry''s ear. 
''W-what are you d-doing? St-stop it!'' 
''I''m not doing anything! Shut up and don''t move!'' 
''I c-can''t see! I''ve g-gone blind! I - '' 
''I said shut up!'' 
Harry stood stock still, turning his sightless eyes left and right. The cold was so intense he was shivering all over; goose bumps had erupted up his arms and the hairs on the back of his neck were standing up - he opened his eyes to their fullest extent, staring blankly around, unseeing. 
It was impossible . . . they couldn''t be here . . . not in Little Whinging . . . he strained his ears . . . he would hear them before he saw them . . . 
''I''ll t-tell Dad!'' Dudley whimpered. ''W-where are you? What are you d-do-?'' 
''Will you shut up?'' Harry hissed, ''I''m trying to lis- '' 
But he fell silent. He had heard just the thing he had been dreading. 
There was something in the alleyway apart from themselves, something that was drawing long, hoarse, rattling breaths. Harry felt a horrible jolt of dread as he stood trembling in the freezing air. 
''C-cut it out! Stop doing it! I''ll h-hit you, I swear I will!'' 
''Dudley, shut - '' 
WHAM. 
A fist made contact with the side of Harry''s head, lifting him off his feet. Small white lights popped in front of his eyes. For the second time in an hour Harry felt as though his head had been cleaved in two; next moment, he had landed hard on the ground and his wand had flown out of his hand. 
''You moron, Dudley!'' Harry yelled, his eyes watering with pain as he scrambled to his hands and knees, feeling around frantically n the blackness. He heard Dudley blundering away, hitting the alley fence, stumbling. 
''DUDLEY, COME BACK! YOU''RE RUNNING RIGHT AT IT!'' 
There was a horrible squealing yell and Dudley''s footsteps topped. At the same moment, Harry felt a creeping chill behind him that could mean only one thing. There was more than one. 
''DUDLEY, KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT! WHATEVER YOU DO, KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT! Wand!'' Harry muttered frantically, his hands flying over the ground like spiders. ''Where''s - wand - come on - lumos!'' 
He said the spell automatically, desperate for light to help him n his search - and to his disbelieving relief, light flared inches from his right hand - the wand tip had ignited. Harry snatched it up, scrambled to his feet and turned around. 
His stomach turned over. 
A towering, hooded figure was gliding smoothly towards him, hovering over the ground, no feet or face visible beneath its robes, sucking on the night as it came. 
Stumbling backwards, Harry raised his wand. 
''Expecto patronum!'' 
A silvery wisp of vapour shot from the tip of the wand and the Dementor slowed, but the spell hadn''t worked properly; tripping over his own feet, Harry retreated further as the Dementor bore down upon him, panic fogging his brain - concentrate - 
A pair of grey, slimy, scabbed hands slid from inside the Dementor''s robes, reaching for him. A rushing noise filled Harry''s ears. 
''Expecto patronum!'' 
His voice sounded dim and distant. Another wisp of silver smoke, feebler than the last, drifted from the wand - he couldn''t do it any more, he couldn''t work the spell. 
There was laughter inside his own head, shrill, high-pitched laughter . . . he could smell the Dementor''s putrid, death-cold breath filling his own lungs, drowning him - think . . . something happy . . . 
But there was no happiness in him . . . the Dementor''s icy fingers were closing on his throat - the high-patched laughter was growing louder and louder, and a voice spoke inside his head: ''Bow to death, Harry . . . it might even be painless . . . I would not know . . . I have never died 
He was never going to see Ron and Hermione again - 
And their faces burst clearly into his mind as he fought for breath. 
''EXPECTO PATRONUM!'' 
An enormous silver stag erupted from the tip of Harry''s wand; it''s antlers caught the Dementor in the place where the heart should have been; it was thrown backwards, weightless as darkness, and as the stag charged, the Dementor swooped away, bat-like and defeated. 
''THIS WAY!'' Harry shouted at the stag. Wheeling around, he sprinted down the alleyway, holding the lit wand aloft. ''DUDLEY? DUDLEY!'' 
He had run barely a dozen steps when he reached them: Dudley was curled up on the ground, his arms clamped over his face. A second Dementor was crouching low over him, gripping his wrists in its slimy hands, prising them slowly, almost lovingly apart, lowering its hooded head towards Dudley''s face as though about to kiss him. 
''GET IT!'' Harry bellowed, and with a rushing, roaring sound, the silver stag he had conjured came galloping past him. The Dementor''s eyeless face was barely an inch from Dudley''s when the silver antlers caught it; the thing was thrown up into the air and, like its fellow, it soared away and was absorbed into the darkness; the stag cantered to the end of the alleyway and dissolved into silver mist. 
Moon, stars and streetlamps burst back into life. A warm breeze swept the alleyway. Trees rustled in neighbouring gardens and the mundane rumble of cars in Magnolia Crescent filled the air again. 
Harry stood quite still, all his senses vibrating, taking in the abrupt return to normality. After a moment, he became aware that his T-shirt was sticking to him; he was drenched in sweat. 
He could not believe what had just happened. Dementors here, in Little Whinging. 
Dudley lay curled up on the ground, whimpering and shaking. Harry bent down to see whether he was in a fit state to stand up, but then he heard loud, running footsteps behind him. Instinctively raising his wand again, he span on his heel to face the newcomer. 
Mrs Figg, their batty old neighbour, came panting into sight. Her grizzled grey hair was escaping from its hairnet, a clanking String shopping bag was swinging from her wrist and her feet were halfway out of her tartan carpet slippers. Harry made to stow his wand hurriedly out of sight, but - 
''Don''t put it away, idiot boy!'' she shrieked. ''What if there are more of them around? Oh, I''m going to kill Mundungus Fletcher!''

K. Rowling. The novels chronicle the life of a young wizard, Harry Potter, and his friends Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley, all of whom are students at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The main story arc concerns Harry''s struggle against Lord Voldemort, a dark wizard who intends to become immortal, overthrow the wizard governing body known as the Ministry of Magic, and subjugate all wizards and muggles, a reference term that means non-magical people. 

Since the release of the first novel, Harry Potter and the Philosopher''s Stone, on 26 June 1997, the books have found immense popularity, critical acclaim and commercial success worldwide. They have attracted a wide adult audience as well as younger readers, and are often considered cornerstones of modern young adult literature. The series has also had its share of criticism, including concern about the increasingly dark tone as the series progressed, as well as the often gruesome and graphic violence it depicts. As of May 2013, the books have sold more than 500 million copies worldwide, making them the best-selling book series in history, and have been translated into seventy-three languages. The last four books consecutively set records as the fastest-selling books in history, with the final instalment selling roughly eleven million copies in the United States within twenty-four hours of its release.

Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, ‘and what is the use of a book,’ thought Alice ‘without pictures or conversations?’

So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.

There was nothing so very remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, ‘Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!’ (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.

In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how in the world she was to get out again.

The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well.

Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed; it was labelled ‘ORANGE MARMALADE’, but to her great disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it.

‘Well!’ thought Alice to herself, ‘after such a fall as this, I shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they’ll all think me at home! Why, I wouldn’t say anything about it, even if I fell off the top of the house!’ (Which was very likely true.)

Down, down, down. Would the fall never come to an end! ‘I wonder how many miles I’ve fallen by this time?’ she said aloud. ‘I must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would be four thousand miles down, I think—’ (for, you see, Alice had learnt several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and though this was not a very good opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still it was good practice to say it over) ‘—yes, that’s about the right distance—but then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I’ve got to?’ (Alice had no idea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to say.)

Presently she began again. ‘I wonder if I shall fall right through the earth! How funny it’ll seem to come out among the people that walk with their heads downward! The Antipathies, I think—’ (she was rather glad there was no one listening, this time, as it didn’t sound at all the right word) ‘—but I shall have to ask them what the name of the country is, you know. Please, Ma’am, is this New Zealand or Australia?’ (and she tried to curtsey as she spoke—fancy curtseying as you’re falling through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) ‘And what an ignorant little girl she’ll think me for asking! No, it’ll never do to ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.’

Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began talking again. ‘Dinah’ll miss me very much to-night, I should think!’ (Dinah was the cat.) ‘I hope they’ll remember her saucer of milk at tea-time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are no mice in the air, I’m afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that’s very like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?’ And here Alice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of way, ‘Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?’ and sometimes, ‘Do bats eat cats?’ for, you see, as she couldn’t answer either question, it didn’t much matter which way she put it. She felt that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly, ‘Now, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?’ when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.

Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment: she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it. There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, ‘Oh my ears and whiskers, how late it’s getting!’ She was close behind it when she turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof.

There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to get out again.

Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice’s first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall; but, alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small, but at any rate it would not open any of them. However, on the second time round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!

Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get out of that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head through the doorway; ‘and even if my head would go through,’ thought poor Alice, ‘it would be of very little use without my shoulders. Oh, how I wish I could shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only knew how to begin.’ For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really impossible.

There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this time she found a little bottle on it, (‘which certainly was not here before,’ said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper label, with the words ‘DRINK ME’ beautifully printed on it in large letters.

It was all very well to say ‘Drink me,’ but the wise little Alice was not going to do that in a hurry. ‘No, I’ll look first,’ she said, ‘and see whether it’s marked “poison” or not’; for she had read several nice little histories about children who had got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they would not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them: such as, that a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your finger very deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had never forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked ‘poison,’ it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later.

However, this bottle was not marked ‘poison,’ so Alice ventured to taste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, and hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off.

  *    *    *    *    *    *    *
‘What a curious feeling!’ said Alice; ‘I must be shutting up like a telescope.’

And so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going through the little door into that lovely garden. First, however, she waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further: she felt a little nervous about this; ‘for it might end, you know,’ said Alice to herself, ‘in my going out altogether, like a candle. I wonder what I should be like then?’ And she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out, for she could not remember ever having seen such a thing.

After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when she got to the door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she went back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach it: she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery; and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing sat down and cried.

‘Come, there’s no use in crying like that!’ said Alice to herself, rather sharply; ‘I advise you to leave off this minute!’ She generally gave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom followed it), and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her eyes; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself, for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people. ‘But it’s no use now,’ thought poor Alice, ‘to pretend to be two people! Why, there’s hardly enough of me left to make one respectable person!’

Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table: she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words ‘EAT ME’ were beautifully marked in currants. ‘Well, I’ll eat it,’ said Alice, ‘and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it makes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door; so either way I’ll get into the garden, and I don’t care which happens!’

She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, ‘Which way? Which way?’, holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was growing, and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same size: to be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake, but Alice had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the common way.

So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.

CHAPTER II. The Pool of Tears
‘Curiouser and curiouser!’ cried Alice (she was so much surprised, that for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English); ‘now I’m opening out like the largest telescope that ever was! Good-bye, feet!’ (for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed to be almost out of sight, they were getting so far off). ‘Oh, my poor little feet, I wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears? I’m sure I shan’t be able! I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself about you: you must manage the best way you can;—but I must be kind to them,’ thought Alice, ‘or perhaps they won’t walk the way I want to go! Let me see: I’ll give them a new pair of boots every Christmas.’

And she went on planning to herself how she would manage it. ‘They must go by the carrier,’ she thought; ‘and how funny it’ll seem, sending presents to one’s own feet! And how odd the directions will look!

     Alice’s Right Foot, Esq.
       Hearthrug,
         near The Fender,
           (with Alice’s love).
Oh dear, what nonsense I’m talking!’

Just then her head struck against the roof of the hall: in fact she was now more than nine feet high, and she at once took up the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door.

Poor Alice! It was as much as she could do, lying down on one side, to look through into the garden with one eye; but to get through was more hopeless than ever: she sat down and began to cry again.

‘You ought to be ashamed of yourself,’ said Alice, ‘a great girl like you,’ (she might well say this), ‘to go on crying in this way! Stop this moment, I tell you!’ But she went on all the same, shedding gallons of tears, until there was a large pool all round her, about four inches deep and reaching half down the hall.

After a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance, and she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming. It was the White Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a pair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other: he came trotting along in a great hurry, muttering to himself as he came, ‘Oh! the Duchess, the Duchess! Oh! won’t she be savage if I’ve kept her waiting!’ Alice felt so desperate that she was ready to ask help of any one; so, when the Rabbit came near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, ‘If you please, sir—’ The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid gloves and the fan, and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go.

Alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very hot, she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking: ‘Dear, dear! How queer everything is to-day! And yesterday things went on just as usual. I wonder if I’ve been changed in the night? Let me think: was I the same when I got up this morning? I almost think I can remember feeling a little different. But if I’m not the same, the next question is, Who in the world am I? Ah, that’s the great puzzle!’ And she began thinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age as herself, to see if she could have been changed for any of them.

‘I’m sure I’m not Ada,’ she said, ‘for her hair goes in such long ringlets, and mine doesn’t go in ringlets at all; and I’m sure I can’t be Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she, oh! she knows such a very little! Besides, she’s she, and I’m I, and—oh dear, how puzzling it all is! I’ll try if I know all the things I used to know. Let me see: four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen, and four times seven is—oh dear! I shall never get to twenty at that rate! However, the Multiplication Table doesn’t signify: let’s try Geography. London is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of Rome, and Rome—no, that’s all wrong, I’m certain! I must have been changed for Mabel! I’ll try and say “How doth the little—“’ and she crossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons, and began to repeat it, but her voice sounded hoarse and strange, and the words did not come the same as they used to do:—

     ‘How doth the little crocodile
      Improve his shining tail,
     And pour the waters of the Nile
      On every golden scale!

     ‘How cheerfully he seems to grin,
      How neatly spread his claws,
     And welcome little fishes in
      With gently smiling jaws!’ 
‘I’m sure those are not the right words,’ said poor Alice, and her eyes filled with tears again as she went on, ‘I must be Mabel after all, and I shall have to go and live in that poky little house, and have next to no toys to play with, and oh! ever so many lessons to learn! No, I’ve made up my mind about it; if I’m Mabel, I’ll stay down here! It’ll be no use their putting their heads down and saying “Come up again, dear!” I shall only look up and say “Who am I then? Tell me that first, and then, if I like being that person, I’ll come up: if not, I’ll stay down here till I’m somebody else”—but, oh dear!’ cried Alice, with a sudden burst of tears, ‘I do wish they would put their heads down! I am so very tired of being all alone here!’

As she said this she looked down at her hands, and was surprised to see that she had put on one of the Rabbit’s little white kid gloves while she was talking. ‘How can I have done that?’ she thought. ‘I must be growing small again.’ She got up and went to the table to measure herself by it, and found that, as nearly as she could guess, she was now about two feet high, and was going on shrinking rapidly: she soon found out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding, and she dropped it hastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether.

‘That was a narrow escape!’ said Alice, a good deal frightened at the sudden change, but very glad to find herself still in existence; ‘and now for the garden!’ and she ran with all speed back to the little door: but, alas! the little door was shut again, and the little golden key was lying on the glass table as before, ‘and things are worse than ever,’ thought the poor child, ‘for I never was so small as this before, never! And I declare it’s too bad, that it is!’

As she said these words her foot slipped, and in another moment, splash! she was up to her chin in salt water. Her first idea was that she had somehow fallen into the sea, ‘and in that case I can go back by railway,’ she said to herself. (Alice had been to the seaside once in her life, and had come to the general conclusion, that wherever you go to on the English coast you find a number of bathing machines in the sea, some children digging in the sand with wooden spades, then a row of lodging houses, and behind them a railway station.) However, she soon made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine feet high.

‘I wish I hadn’t cried so much!’ said Alice, as she swam about, trying to find her way out. ‘I shall be punished for it now, I suppose, by being drowned in my own tears! That will be a queer thing, to be sure! However, everything is queer to-day.’

Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way off, and she swam nearer to make out what it was: at first she thought it must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then she remembered how small she was now, and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself.

‘Would it be of any use, now,’ thought Alice, ‘to speak to this mouse? Everything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should think very likely it can talk: at any rate, there’s no harm in trying.’ So she began: ‘O Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool? I am very tired of swimming about here, O Mouse!’ (Alice thought this must be the right way of speaking to a mouse: she had never done such a thing before, but she remembered having seen in her brother’s Latin Grammar, ‘A mouse—of a mouse—to a mouse—a mouse—O mouse!’) The Mouse looked at her rather inquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes, but it said nothing.

‘Perhaps it doesn’t understand English,’ thought Alice; ‘I daresay it’s a French mouse, come over with William the Conqueror.’ (For, with all her knowledge of history, Alice had no very clear notion how long ago anything had happened.) So she began again: ‘Ou est ma chatte?’ which was the first sentence in her French lesson-book. The Mouse gave a sudden leap out of the water, and seemed to quiver all over with fright. ‘Oh, I beg your pardon!’ cried Alice hastily, afraid that she had hurt the poor animal’s feelings. ‘I quite forgot you didn’t like cats.’

‘Not like cats!’ cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate voice. ‘Would you like cats if you were me?’

‘Well, perhaps not,’ said Alice in a soothing tone: ‘don’t be angry about it. And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah: I think you’d take a fancy to cats if you could only see her. She is such a dear quiet thing,’ Alice went on, half to herself, as she swam lazily about in the pool, ‘and she sits purring so nicely by the fire, licking her paws and washing her face—and she is such a nice soft thing to nurse—and she’s such a capital one for catching mice—oh, I beg your pardon!’ cried Alice again, for this time the Mouse was bristling all over, and she felt certain it must be really offended. ‘We won’t talk about her any more if you’d rather not.’

‘We indeed!’ cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end of his tail. ‘As if I would talk on such a subject! Our family always hated cats: nasty, low, vulgar things! Don’t let me hear the name again!’

‘I won’t indeed!’ said Alice, in a great hurry to change the subject of conversation. ‘Are you—are you fond—of—of dogs?’ The Mouse did not answer, so Alice went on eagerly: ‘There is such a nice little dog near our house I should like to show you! A little bright-eyed terrier, you know, with oh, such long curly brown hair! And it’ll fetch things when you throw them, and it’ll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts of things—I can’t remember half of them—and it belongs to a farmer, you know, and he says it’s so useful, it’s worth a hundred pounds! He says it kills all the rats and—oh dear!’ cried Alice in a sorrowful tone, ‘I’m afraid I’ve offended it again!’ For the Mouse was swimming away from her as hard as it could go, and making quite a commotion in the pool as it went.

So she called softly after it, ‘Mouse dear! Do come back again, and we won’t talk about cats or dogs either, if you don’t like them!’ When the Mouse heard this, it turned round and swam slowly back to her: its face was quite pale (with passion, Alice thought), and it said in a low trembling voice, ‘Let us get to the shore, and then I’ll tell you my history, and you’ll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.’

It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the birds and animals that had fallen into it: there were a Duck and a Dodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious creatures. Alice led the way, and the whole party swam to the shore.






CHAPTER III. A Caucus-Race and a Long Tale
They were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the bank—the birds with draggled feathers, the animals with their fur clinging close to them, and all dripping wet, cross, and uncomfortable.

The first question of course was, how to get dry again: they had a consultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed quite natural to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with them, as if she had known them all her life. Indeed, she had quite a long argument with the Lory, who at last turned sulky, and would only say, ‘I am older than you, and must know better’; and this Alice would not allow without knowing how old it was, and, as the Lory positively refused to tell its age, there was no more to be said.

At last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among them, called out, ‘Sit down, all of you, and listen to me! I’ll soon make you dry enough!’ They all sat down at once, in a large ring, with the Mouse in the middle. Alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it, for she felt sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon.

‘Ahem!’ said the Mouse with an important air, ‘are you all ready? This is the driest thing I know. Silence all round, if you please! “William the Conqueror, whose cause was favoured by the pope, was soon submitted to by the English, who wanted leaders, and had been of late much accustomed to usurpation and conquest. Edwin and Morcar, the earls of Mercia and Northumbria—“’

‘Ugh!’ said the Lory, with a shiver.

‘I beg your pardon!’ said the Mouse, frowning, but very politely: ‘Did you speak?’

‘Not I!’ said the Lory hastily.

‘I thought you did,’ said the Mouse. ‘—I proceed. “Edwin and Morcar, the earls of Mercia and Northumbria, declared for him: and even Stigand, the patriotic archbishop of Canterbury, found it advisable—“’

‘Found what?’ said the Duck.

‘Found it,’ the Mouse replied rather crossly: ‘of course you know what “it” means.’

‘I know what “it” means well enough, when I find a thing,’ said the Duck: ‘it’s generally a frog or a worm. The question is, what did the archbishop find?’

The Mouse did not notice this question, but hurriedly went on, ‘“—found it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and offer him the crown. William’s conduct at first was moderate. But the insolence of his Normans—” How are you getting on now, my dear?’ it continued, turning to Alice as it spoke.

‘As wet as ever,’ said Alice in a melancholy tone: ‘it doesn’t seem to dry me at all.’

‘In that case,’ said the Dodo solemnly, rising to its feet, ‘I move that the meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more energetic remedies—’

‘Speak English!’ said the Eaglet. ‘I don’t know the meaning of half those long words, and, what’s more, I don’t believe you do either!’ And the Eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile: some of the other birds tittered audibly.

‘What I was going to say,’ said the Dodo in an offended tone, ‘was, that the best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race.’

‘What is a Caucus-race?’ said Alice; not that she wanted much to know, but the Dodo had paused as if it thought that somebody ought to speak, and no one else seemed inclined to say anything.

‘Why,’ said the Dodo, ‘the best way to explain it is to do it.’ (And, as you might like to try the thing yourself, some winter day, I will tell you how the Dodo managed it.)

First it marked out a race-course, in a sort of circle, (‘the exact shape doesn’t matter,’ it said,) and then all the party were placed along the course, here and there. There was no ‘One, two, three, and away,’ but they began running when they liked, and left off when they liked, so that it was not easy to know when the race was over. However, when they had been running half an hour or so, and were quite dry again, the Dodo suddenly called out ‘The race is over!’ and they all crowded round it, panting, and asking, ‘But who has won?’

This question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of thought, and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon its forehead (the position in which you usually see Shakespeare, in the pictures of him), while the rest waited in silence. At last the Dodo said, ‘Everybody has won, and all must have prizes.’

‘But who is to give the prizes?’ quite a chorus of voices asked.

‘Why, she, of course,’ said the Dodo, pointing to Alice with one finger; and the whole party at once crowded round her, calling out in a confused way, ‘Prizes! Prizes!’

Alice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand in her pocket, and pulled out a box of comfits, (luckily the salt water had not got into it), and handed them round as prizes. There was exactly one a-piece all round.

‘But she must have a prize herself, you know,’ said the Mouse.

‘Of course,’ the Dodo replied very gravely. ‘What else have you got in your pocket?’ he went on, turning to Alice.

‘Only a thimble,’ said Alice sadly.

‘Hand it over here,’ said the Dodo.

Then they all crowded round her once more, while the Dodo solemnly presented the thimble, saying ‘We beg your acceptance of this elegant thimble’; and, when it had finished this short speech, they all cheered.

Alice thought the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked so grave that she did not dare to laugh; and, as she could not think of anything to say, she simply bowed, and took the thimble, looking as solemn as she could.

The next thing was to eat the comfits: this caused some noise and confusion, as the large birds complained that they could not taste theirs, and the small ones choked and had to be patted on the back. However, it was over at last, and they sat down again in a ring, and begged the Mouse to tell them something more.

‘You promised to tell me your history, you know,’ said Alice, ‘and why it is you hate—C and D,’ she added in a whisper, half afraid that it would be offended again.

‘Mine is a long and a sad tale!’ said the Mouse, turning to Alice, and sighing.

‘It is a long tail, certainly,’ said Alice, looking down with wonder at the Mouse’s tail; ‘but why do you call it sad?’ And she kept on puzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking, so that her idea of the tale was something like this:—

         ‘Fury said to a
         mouse, That he
        met in the
       house,
     “Let us
      both go to
       law: I will
        prosecute
         you.—Come,
           I’ll take no
           denial; We
          must have a
        trial: For
      really this
     morning I’ve
    nothing
    to do.”
      Said the
      mouse to the
       cur, “Such
        a trial,
         dear Sir,
            With
          no jury
        or judge,
       would be
      wasting
      our
      breath.”
        “I’ll be
        judge, I’ll
         be jury,”
             Said
         cunning
          old Fury:
          “I’ll
          try the
            whole
            cause,
              and
           condemn
           you
          to
           death.”’ ', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Dp6aAR4HL._SX357_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg', '{fantastic,funny,prose}', 22, 'Chapter One – Down the Rabbit Hole: Alice is feeling bored and drowsy while sitting on the riverbank with her elder sister. She then notices a talking, clothed White Rabbit with a pocket watch run past. She follows it down a rabbit hole when suddenly she falls a long way to a curious hall with many locked doors of all sizes. She finds a small key to a door too small for her to fit through, but through it she sees an attractive garden. She then discovers a bottle on a table labelled "DRINK ME," the contents of which cause her to shrink too small to reach the key which she has left on the table. She eats a cake with "EAT ME" written on it in currants as the chapter closes.

Chapter Two – The Pool of Tears: Chapter Two opens with Alice growing to such a tremendous size her head hits the ceiling. Alice is unhappy and, as she cries, her tears flood the hallway. After shrinking down again due to a fan she had picked up, Alice swims through her own tears and meets a Mouse, who is swimming as well. She tries to make small talk with him in elementary French (thinking he may be a French mouse) but her opening gambit "Où est ma chatte?" ("Where is my cat?") offends the mouse and he tries to escape her.

Chapter Three – The Caucus Race and a Long Tale: The sea of tears becomes crowded with other animals and birds that have been swept away by the rising waters. Alice and the other animals convene on the bank and the question among them is how to get dry again. The Mouse gives them a very dry lecture on William the Conqueror. A Dodo decides that the best thing to dry them off would be a Caucus-Race, which consists of everyone running in a circle with no clear winner. Alice eventually frightens all the animals away, unwittingly, by talking about her (moderately ferocious) cat.

Chapter Four – The Rabbit Sends a Little Bill: The White Rabbit appears again in search of the Duchess''s gloves and fan. Mistaking her for his maidservant, Mary Ann, he orders Alice to go into the house and retrieve them, but once she gets inside she starts growing. The horrified Rabbit orders his gardener, Bill the Lizard, to climb on the roof and go down the chimney. Outside, Alice hears the voices of animals that have gathered to gawk at her giant arm. The crowd hurls pebbles at her, which turn into little cakes. Alice eats them, and they reduce her again in size.');

Явление 1

Гостиная, в ней большие часы, справа дверь в спальню Софии, откудова слышно фортопияно с флейтою, которые потом умолкают.

Лизанька середи комнаты спит, свесившись с кресел.

(Утро, чуть день брезжится.)

Лизанька (вдруг просыпается, встает с кресел, оглядывается)

Светает!.. Ах! как скоро ночь минула!

Вчера просилась спать – отказ.

«Ждем друга». – Нужен глаз да глаз,

Не спи, покудова не скатишься со стула.

Теперь вот только что вздремнула,

Уж день!.. сказать им…

(Стучится к Софии.)

Господа,

Эй! Софья Павловна, беда:

Зашла беседа ваша за́ночь;

Вы глухи? – Алексей Степаныч!

Сударыня!.. – И страх их не берет!

(Отходит от дверей.)

Ну, гость неприглашенный,

Быть может, батюшка войдет!

Прошу служить у барышни влюбленной!

(Опять к дверям.)

Да расходитесь. Утро. Что-с?

( Голо с Софии )

Который час?

Лизанька

Всё в доме поднялось.

София (из своей комнаты)

Который час?

Лизанька

Седьмой, осьмой, девятый.

София (оттуда же)

Неправда.

Лизанька (прочь от дверей)

Ах! амур проклятый!

И слышат, не хотят понять,

Ну что́ бы ставни им отнять?

Переведу часы, хоть знаю: будет гонка,

Заставлю их играть.

(Лезет на стул, передвигает стрелку, часы бьют и играют.)

Явление 2

Лиза и Фамусов .

Лиза

Ах! барин!

Фамусов

Барин, да.

(Останавливает часовую музыку.)

Ведь экая шалунья ты девчонка.

Не мог придумать я, что это за беда!

То флейта слышится, то будто фортопьяно;

Для Софьи слишком было б рано??..

Лиза

Нет, сударь, я… лишь невзначай…

Фамусов

Вот то-то невзначай, за вами примечай;

Так верно с умыслом.

(Жмется к ней и заигрывает.)

Ой! зелье, баловница.

Лиза

Вы баловник, к лицу ль вам эти лица!

Фамусов

Скромна, а ничего кроме́

Проказ и ветру на уме.

Лиза

Пустите, ветреники сами,

Опомнитесь, вы старики…

Фамусов

Почти.

Лиза

Ну, кто придет, куда мы с вами?

Фамусов

Кому сюда придти?

Ведь Софья спит?

Лиза

Сейчас започивала.

Фамусов

Сейчас! А ночь?

Лиза

Ночь целую читала.

Фамусов

Вишь, прихоти какие завелись!

Лиза

Всё по-французски, вслух, читает запершись.

Фамусов

Скажи-ка, что глаза ей портить не годится,

И в чтеньи прок-от не велик:

Ей сна нет от французских книг,

А мне от русских больно спится.

Лиза

Что встанет, доложусь,

Извольте же идти; разбудите, боюсь.

Фамусов

Чего будить? Сама часы заводишь,

На весь квартал симфонию гремишь.

Лиза (как можно громче)

Да полноте-с!

Фамусов (зажимает ей рот)

Помилуй, как кричишь.

С ума ты сходишь?

Лиза

Боюсь, чтобы не вышло из того…

Фамусов

Чего?

Лиза

Пора, сударь, вам знать, вы не ребенок;

У девушек сон утренний так тонок;

Чуть дверью скрипнешь, чуть шепнешь:

Всё слышат…

Фамусов

Всё ты лжешь.

(Голос Софии)

Эй, Лиза!

Фамусов (торопливо)

Тс!

(Крадется вон из комнаты на цыпочках.)

Лиза (одна)

Ушел. Ах! от господ подалей;

У них беды себе на всякий час готовь,

Минуй нас пуще всех печалей

И барский гнев, и барская любовь.

Явление 3

Лиза , София со свечкою, за ней Молчалин .

София

Что, Лиза, на тебя напало?

Шумишь…

Лиза

Конечно, вам расстаться тяжело?

До света запершись, и кажется всё мало?

София

Ах, в самом деле рассвело!

(Тушит свечу.)

И свет и грусть. Как быстры ночи!

Лиза

Тужите, знай, со стороны нет мочи,

Сюда ваш батюшка зашел, я обмерла;

Вертелась перед ним, не помню что врала;

Ну что же стали вы? поклон, сударь, отвесьте.

Подите, сердце не на месте;

Смотрите на часы, взгляните-ка в окно:

Валит народ по улицам давно;

А в доме стук, ходьба, метут и убирают.

София

Счастливые часов не наблюдают.

Лиза

Не наблюдайте, ваша власть;

А что в ответ за вас, конечно, мне попасть.

София (Молчалину)

Идите; целый день еще потерпим скуку.

Лиза

Бог с вами-с; прочь возьмите руку.

(Разводит их, Молчалин в дверях сталкивается с Фамусовым.)

Явление 4

София , Лиза , Молчалин , Фамусов .

Фамусов

Что за оказия! Молчалин, ты, брат?

Молчалин

Я-с.

Фамусов

Зачем же здесь? и в этот час?

И Софья!.. Здравствуй, Софья, что ты

Так рано поднялась! а? для какой заботы?

И как вас бог не в пору вместе свел?

София

Он только что теперь вошел.

Молчалин

Сейчас с прогулки.

Фамусов

Друг. Нельзя ли для прогулок

Подальше выбрать закоулок?

А ты, сударыня, чуть из постели прыг,

С мужчиной! с молодым! – Занятье для девицы!

Всю ночь читает небылицы,

И вот плоды от этих книг!

А всё Кузнецкий мост, и вечные французы,

Оттуда моды к нам, и авторы, и музы:

Губители карманов и сердец!

Когда избавит нас творец

От шляпок их! чепцов! и шпилек! и булавок!

И книжных и бисквитных лавок! —

София

Позвольте, батюшка, кружится голова;

Я от испуги дух перевожу едва;

Изволили вбежать вы так проворно,

Смешалась я.

Фамусов

Благодарю покорно,

Я скоро к ним вбежал!

Я помешал! я испужал!

Я, Софья Павловна, расстроен сам, день целый

Нет отдыха, мечусь как словно угорелый.

По должности, по службе хлопотня,

Тот пристает, другой, всем дело до меня!

По ждал ли новых я хлопот? чтоб был обманут…

София (сквозь слезы)

Кем, батюшка?

Фамусов

Вот попрекать мне станут,

Что без толку всегда журю.

Не плачь, я дело говорю:

Уж об твоем ли не радели

Об воспитаньи! с колыбели!

Мать умерла: умел я принанять

В мадам Розье вторую мать.

Старушку-золото в надзор к тебе приставил:

Умна была, нрав тихий, редких правил.

Одно не к чести служит ей:

За лишних в год пятьсот рублей

Сманить себя другими допустила.

Да не в мадаме сила.

Не надобно иного образца,

Когда в глазах пример отца.

Смотри ты на меня: не хвастаю сложеньем,

Однако бодр и свеж, и дожил до седин,

Свободен, вдов, себе я господин…

Монашеским известен поведеньем!..

Лиза

Осмелюсь я, сударь…

Фамусов

Молчать!

Ужасный век! Не знаешь, что начать!

Все умудрились не по ле́там,

А пуще дочери, да сами добряки.

Дались нам эти языки!

Берем же побродяг, и в дом и по билетам,

Чтоб наших дочерей всему учить, всему —

И танцам! и пенью́! и нежностям! и вздохам!

Как будто в жены их готовим скоморохам.

Ты, посетитель, что? ты здесь, сударь, к чему?

Безродного пригрел и ввел в мое семейство,

Дал чин асессора и взял в секретари;

В Москву переведен через мое содейство;

И будь не я, коптел бы ты в Твери.

София

Я гнева вашего никак не растолкую.

Он в доме здесь живет, великая напасть!

Шел в комнату, попал в другую.

Фамусов

Попал или хотел попасть?

Да вместе вы зачем? Нельзя, чтобы случайно.

София

Вот в чем, однако, случай весь:

Как давече вы с Лизой были здесь,

Перепугал меня ваш голос чрезвычайно,

И бросилась сюда я со всех ног.

Фамусов

Пожалуй, на меня всю суматоху сложит.

Не в пору голос мой наделал им тревог!

София

По смутном сне безделица тревожит;

Сказать вам сон: поймете вы тогда.

Фамусов

Что за история?

София

Вам рассказать?

Фамусов

Ну да.

(Садится.)

София

Позвольте… видите ль… сначала

Цветистый луг; и я искала

Траву

Какую-то, не вспомню наяву.

Вдруг милый человек, один из тех, кого мы

Увидим – будто век знакомы,

Явился тут со мной; и вкрадчив, и умен,

Но робок… Знаете, кто в бедности рожден…

Фамусов

Ах! матушка, не довершай удара!

Кто беден, тот тебе не пара.

София

Потом пропало всё: луга и небеса. —

Мы в темной комнате. Для довершенья чуда

Раскрылся пол – и вы оттуда,

Бледны, как смерть, и дыбом волоса!

Тут с громом распахнули двери

Какие-то не люди и не звери,

Нас врознь – и мучили сидевшего со мной.

Он будто мне дороже всех сокровищ,

Хочу к нему – вы тащите с собой:

Нас провожают стон, рев, хохот, свист чудовищ!

Он вслед кричит!.. —

Проснулась. – Кто-то говорит. —

Ваш голос был; что́, думаю, так рано?

Бегу сюда – и вас обоих нахожу.

Фамусов

Да, дурен сон; как погляжу,

Тут всё есть, коли нет обмана:

И черти и любовь, и страхи и цветы.

Ну, сударь мой, а ты?

Молчалин

Я слышал голос ваш.

Фамусов

Забавно.

Дался им голос мой, и как себе исправно

Всем слышится, и всех сзывает до зари!

На голос мой спешил, за чем же? – говори.

Молчалин

С бумагами-с.

Фамусов

Да! их недоставало.

Помилуйте, что это вдруг припало

Усердье к письменным делам!

(Встает.)

Ну, Сонюшка, тебе покой я дам:

Бывают странны сны, а наяву страннее;

Искала ты себе травы,

На друга набрела скорее;

Повыкинь вздор из головы;

Где чудеса, там мало складу. —

Поди-ка, ляг, усни опять.

(Молчалину.)

Идем бумаги разбирать.

Молчалин

Я только нес их для докладу,

Что в ход нельзя пустить без справок, без иных,

Противуречья есть, и многое не дельно.

Фамусов

Боюсь, сударь, я одного смертельно,

Чтоб множество не накоплялось их;

Дай волю вам, оно бы и засело;

А у меня, что дело, что не дело,

Обычай мой такой:

Подписано, так с плеч долой.

(Уходит с Молчалиным, в дверях пропускает его вперед.)

Явление 5

София , Лиза .

Лиза

Ну вот у праздника! ну вот вам и потеха!

Однако нет, теперь уж не до смеха;

В глазах темно, и замерла душа;

Грех не беда, молва не хороша.

София

Что́ мне молва? Кто хочет, так и судит,

Да батюшка задуматься принудит:

Брюзглив, неугомонен, скор,

Таков всегда, а с этих пор…

Ты можешь посудить…

Лиза

Сужу-с не по рассказам;

Запрет он вас; – добро еще со мной;

А то, помилуй бог, как разом

Меня, Молчалина и всех с двора долой.

София

Подумаешь, как счастье своенравно!

Бывает хуже, с рук сойдет;

Когда ж печальное ничто на ум не йдет,

Забылись музыкой, и время шло так плавно;

Судьба нас будто берегла;

Ни беспокойства, ни сомненья…

А горе ждет из-за угла.

Лиза

Вот то-то-с, моего вы глупого сужденья

Не жалуете никогда:

Ан вот беда.

На что вам лучшего пророка?

Твердила я: в любви не будет в этой прока

Ни во́ веки веков.

Как все московские, ваш батюшка таков:

Желал бы зятя он с звездами, да с чинами,

А при звездах не все богаты, между нами;

Ну разумеется, к тому б

И деньги, чтоб пожить, чтоб мог давать он ба́лы;

Вот, например, полковник Скалозуб:

И золотой мешок, и метит в генералы.

София

Куда как мил! и весело мне страх

Выслушивать о фрунте и рядах;

Он слова умного не выговорил сроду, —

Мне всё равно, что за него, что в воду.

Лиза

Да-с, так сказать, речист, а больно не хитер;

Но будь военный, будь он статский,

Кто так чувствителен, и весел, и остер,

Как Александр Андреич Чацкий!

Не для того, чтоб вас смутить;

Давно прошло, не воротить,

А помнится…

София

Что помнится? Он славно

Пересмеять умеет всех;

Болтает, шутит, мне забавно;

Делить со всяким можно смех.

Лиза

И только? будто бы? – Слезами обливался,

Я помню, бедный он, как с вами расставался. —

Что, сударь, плачете? живите-ка смеясь…

А он в ответ: «Недаром, Лиза, плачу,

Кому известно, что́ найду я воротясь?

И сколько, может быть, утрачу!» —

Бедняжка будто знал, что года через три…

София

Послушай, вольности ты лишней не бери.

Я очень ветрено, быть может, поступила,

И знаю, и винюсь; но где же изменила?

Кому? чтоб укорять неверностью могли.

Да, с Чацким, правда, мы воспитаны, росли;

Привычка вместе быть день каждый неразлучно

Связала детскою нас дружбой; но потом

Он съехал, уж у нас ему казалось скучно,

И редко посещал наш дом;

Потом опять прикинулся влюбленным,

Взыскательным и огорченным!!..

Остер, умен, красноречив,

В друзьях особенно счастлив.

Вот об себе задумал он высоко —

Охота странствовать напала на него.

Ах! если любит кто кого,

Зачем ума искать и ездить так далёко?

Лиза

Где носится? в каких краях?

Лечился, говорят, на кислых он водах,

Не от болезни, чай, от скуки, – повольнее.

София

И, верно, счастлив там, где люди посмешнее.

Кого люблю я, не таков:

Молчалин за других себя забыть готов,

Враг дерзости, – всегда застенчиво, несмело

Ночь целую с кем можно так провесть!

Сидим, а на дворе давно уж побелело,

Как думаешь? чем заняты?

Лиза

Бог весть,

Сударыня, мое ли это дело?

София

Возьмет он руку, к сердцу жмет,

Из глубины души вздохнет,

Ни слова вольного, и так вся ночь проходит,

Рука с рукой, и глаз с меня не сводит. —

Смеешься! можно ли! чем повод подала

Тебе я к хохоту такому!

Лиза

Мне-с?.. ваша тетушка на ум теперь пришла,

Как молодой француз сбежал у ней из дому.

Голубушка! хотела схоронить

Свою досаду, не сумела:

Забыла волосы чернить

И через три дни поседела.

(Продолжает хохотать.)

София (с огорчением)

Вот так же обо мне потом заговорят.

Лиза

Простите, право, как бог свят,

Хотела я, чтоб этот смех дурацкий

Вас несколько развеселить помог.

Явление 6

София , Лиза , Слуга , за ним Чацкий .

Слуга

К вам Александр Андреич Чацкий.

(Уходит.)

Явление 7

София , Лиза , Чацкий .

Чацкий

Чуть свет – уж на ногах! и я у ваших ног.

(С жаром целует руку.)

Ну поцелуйте же, не ждали? говорите!

Что ж, ради? Нет? В лицо мне посмотрите.

Удивлены? и только? вот прием!

Как будто не прошло недели;

Как будто бы вчера вдвоем

Мы мочи нет друг другу надоели;

Ни на́волос любви! куда как хороши!

И между тем, не вспомнюсь, без души,

Я сорок пять часов, глаз мигом не прищуря,

Верст больше седьмисот пронесся, – ветер, буря;

И растерялся весь, и падал сколько раз —

И вот за подвиги награда!

София

Ах! Чацкий, я вам очень рада.

Чацкий

Вы ради? в добрый час.

Однако искренно кто ж радуется эдак?

Мне кажется, так напоследок,

Людей и лошадей знобя,

Я только тешил сам себя.

Лиза

Вот, сударь, если бы вы были за дверями,

Ей-богу, нет пяти минут,

Как поминали вас мы тут.

Сударыня, скажите сами.

София

Всегда, не только что теперь. —

Не можете мне сделать вы упрека.

Кто промелькнет, отворит дверь,

Проездом, случаем, из чужа, из далёка —

С вопросом я, хоть будь моряк:

Не повстречал ли где в почтовой вас карете?

Чацкий

Положимте, что так.

Блажен, кто верует, тепло ему на свете! —

Ах! боже мой! ужли я здесь опять,

В Москве! у вас! да как же вас узнать!

Где время то? где возраст тот невинный,

Когда, бывало, в вечер длинный

Мы с вами явимся, исчезнем тут и там,

Играем и шумим по стульям и столам.

А тут ваш батюшка с мадамой, за пикетом;

Мы в темном уголке, и кажется, что в этом!

Вы помните? вздрогнём, что скрипнет столик,

дверь…

София

Ребячество!

Чацкий

Да-с, а теперь,

В седьмнадцать лет вы расцвели прелестно,

Неподражаемо, и это вам известно,

И потому скромны, не смотрите на свет.

Не влюблены ли вы? прошу мне дать ответ,

Без думы, полноте смущаться.

София

Да хоть кого смутят

Вопросы быстрые и любопытный взгляд…

Чацкий

Помилуйте, не вам, чему же удивляться?

Что нового покажет мне Москва?

Вчера был бал, а завтра будет два.

Тот сватался – успел, а тот дал промах.

Всё тот же толк, и те ж стихи в альбомах.

София

Гоненье на Москву. Что значит видеть свет!

Где ж лучше?

Чацкий

Где нас нет.

Ну что ваш батюшка? всё А́нглийского клоба

Старинный, верный член до гроба?

Ваш дядюшка отпрыгал ли свой век?

А этот, как его, он турок или грек?

Тот черномазенький, на ножках журавлиных,

Не знаю, как его зовут,

Куда ни сунься: тут, как тут,

В столовых и в гостиных.

А трое из бульварных лиц,

Которые с полвека молодятся?

Родных мильон у них, и с помощью сестриц

Со всей Европой породнятся.

А наше солнышко? наш клад?

На лбу написано: Театр и Маскерад;

Дом зеленью раскрашен в виде рощи,

Сам толст, его артисты тощи.

На бале, помните, открыли мы вдвоем

За ширмами, в одной из комнат посекретней,

Был спрятан человек и щелкал соловьем,

Певец зимой погоды летней.

А тот чахоточный, родня вам, книгам враг,

В ученый комитет который поселился

И с криком требовал присяг,

Чтоб грамоте никто не знал и не учился?

Опять увидеть их мне суждено судьбой!

Жить с ними надоест, и в ком не сыщешь пятен?

Когда ж постранствуешь, воротишься домой,

И дым Отечества нам сладок и приятен!

София

Вот вас бы с тетушкою свесть,

Чтоб всех знакомых перечесть.

Чацкий

А тетушка? всё девушкой, Минервой?

Всё фрейлиной Екатерины Первой?

Воспитанниц и мосек полон дом?

Ах! к воспитанью перейдем.

Что нынче, так же, как издревле,

Хлопочут набирать учителей полки,

Числом поболее, ценою подешевле?

Не то чтобы в науке далеки;

В России, под великим штрафом,

Нам каждого признать велят

Историком и геогра́фом!

Наш ментор, помните колпак его, халат,

Перст указательный, все признаки ученья

Как наши робкие тревожили умы,

Как с ранних пор привыкли верить мы,

Что нам без немцев нет спасенья! —

А Гильоме, француз, подбитый ветерком?

Он не женат еще?

София

На ком?

Чацкий

Хоть на какой-нибудь княгине

Пульхерии Андревне, например?

София

Танцмейстер! можно ли!

Чацкий

Что ж, он и кавалер.

От нас потребуют с именьем быть и в чине,

А Гильоме!.. – Здесь нынче тон каков

На съездах, на больших, по праздникам приходским?

Господствует еще смешенье языков:

Французского с нижегородским?

София

Смесь языков?

Чацкий

Да, двух, без этого нельзя ж.

София

Но мудрено из них один скроить, как ваш.

Чацкий

По крайней мере не надутый.

Вот новости! – я пользуюсь минутой,

Свиданьем с вами оживлен,

И говорлив; а разве нет времен,

Что я Молчалина глупее? Где он, кстати?

Еще ли не сломил безмолвия печати?

Бывало, песенок где новеньких тетрадь

Увидит, пристает: пожалуйте списать.

А впрочем, он дойдет до степеней известных,

Ведь нынче любят бессловесных.

София (в сторону)

Не человек, змея!

(Громко и принужденно.)

Хочу у вас спросить:

Случалось ли, чтоб вы, смеясь? или в печали?

Ошибкою? добро о ком-нибудь сказали?

Хоть не теперь, а в детстве, может быть.

Чацкий

Когда всё мягко так? и нежно, и незрело?

На что же так давно? вот доброе вам дело:

Звонками только что гремя

И день и ночь по снеговой пустыне,

Спешу к вам, голову сломя.

И как вас нахожу? в каком-то строгом чине!

Вот полчаса холодности терплю!

Лицо святейшей богомолки!.. —

И всё-таки я вас без памяти люблю. —

(Минутное молчание.)

Послушайте, ужли слова мои все колки?

И клонятся к чьему-нибудь вреду?

Но если так: ум с сердцем не в ладу.

Я в чудаках иному чуду

Раз посмеюсь, потом забуду.

Велите ж мне в огонь: пойду как на обед.

София

Да, хорошо – сгорите, если ж нет?

Явление 8

София , Лиза , Чацкий , Фамусов .

Фамусов

Вот и другой.

София

Ах, батюшка, сон в руку.

(Уходит.)

Фамусов (ей вслед вполголоса)

Проклятый сон.

Явление 9

Фамусов , Чацкий (смотрит на дверь, в которую София вышла).

Фамусов

Ну выкинул ты штуку!

Три года не писал двух слов!

И грянул вдруг как с облаков.

(Обнимаются.)

Здорово, друг, здорово, брат, здорово.

Рассказывай, чай, у тебя готово

Собранье важное вестей?

Садись-ка, объяви скорей.

(Садятся.)

Чацкий (рассеянно)

Как Софья Павловна у вас похорошела!

Фамусов

Вам, людям молодым, другого нету дела,

Как замечать девичьи красоты́:

Сказала что-то вскользь, а ты,

Я, чай, надеждами занесся, заколдован.

Чацкий

Ах! нет, надеждами я мало избалован.

Фамусов

«Сон в руку» – мне она изволила шепнуть,

Вот ты задумал…

Чацкий

Я? – Ничуть.

Фамусов

О ком ей снилось? что такое?

Чацкий

Я не отгадчик снов.

Фамусов

Не верь ей, всё пустое.

Чацкий

Я верю собственным глазам;

Век не встречал, подписку дам,

Что б было ей хоть несколько подобно!

Фамусов

Он всё свое. Да расскажи подробно,

Где был? Скитался столько лет!

Откудова теперь?

Чацкий

Теперь мне до того ли!

Хотел объехать целый свет

И не объехал сотой доли.

(Встает поспешно.)

Простите; я спешил скорее видеть вас,

Не заезжал домой. Прощайте! Через час

Явлюсь, подробности малейшей не забуду;

Вам первым, вы потом рассказывайте всюду.

(В дверях.)

Как хороша!

(Уходит.)

Явление 10

Фамусов (один)

Который же из двух?

«Ах! батюшка, сон в руку!»

И говорит мне это вслух!

Ну, виноват! Какого ж дал я крюку!

Молчалин давеча в сомненье ввел меня.

Теперь… да в полмя из огня:

Тот нищий, этот франт-приятель;

Отъявлен мотом, сорванцом;

Что за комиссия, создатель,

Быть взрослой дочери отцом! —

(Уходит.)

Действие II

Явление 1

Фамусов , Слуга .

Фамусов

Петрушка, вечно ты с обновкой,

С разодранным локтем. Достань-ка календарь;

Читай не так, как пономарь;

А с чувством, с толком, с расстановкой.

Постой же. – На листе черкни на записном,

Противу будущей недели:

К Прасковье Федоровне в дом

Во вторник зван я на форели.

Куда как чуден создан свет!

Пофилософствуй – ум вскружится;

То бережешься, то обед:

Ешь три часа, а в три дни не сварится!

Отметь-ка, в тот же день… Нет, нет.

В четверг я зван на погребенье.

Ох, род людской! пришло в забвенье,

Что всякий сам туда же должен лезть,

В тот ларчик, где ни стать, ни сесть.

Но память по себе намерен кто оставить

Житьем похвальным, вот пример:

Покойник был почтенный камергер,

С ключом, и сыну ключ умел доставить;

Богат, и на богатой был женат;

Переженил детей, внучат;

Скончался; все о нем прискорбно поминают,

Кузьма Петрович! Мир ему! —

Что за тузы в Москве живут и умирают! —

Пиши: в четверг, одно уж к одному,

А может, в пятницу, а может, и в субботу,

Я должен у вдовы, у докторши, крестить.

Она не родила, но по расчету

По моему: должна родить.

Явление 2

Фамусов , Слуга , Чацкий .

Фамусов

А! Александр Андреич, просим,

Садитесь-ка.

Чацкий

Вы заняты?

Фамусов (Слуге)

Поди.

(Слуга уходит.)

Да, разные дела на память в книгу вносим,

Забудется того гляди.

Чацкий

Вы что-то не весёлы стали;

Скажите, отчего? Приезд не в пору мой?

Уж Софье Павловне какой

Не приключилось ли печали?

У вас в лице, в движеньях суета.

Фамусов

Ах! батюшка, нашел загадку,

Не весел я!.. В мои лета

Не можно же пускаться мне вприсядку!

Чацкий

Никто не приглашает вас;

Я только что спросил два слова

Об Софье Павловне, быть может, нездорова?

Фамусов

Тьфу, господи прости! Пять тысяч раз

Твердит одно и то же!

То Софьи Павловны на свете нет пригоже,

То Софья Павловна больна.

Скажи, тебе понравилась она?

Обрыскал свет; не хочешь ли жениться?

Чацкий

А вам на что?

Фамусов

Меня не худо бы спроситься,

Ведь я ей несколько сродни;

По крайней мере искони

Отцом недаром называли.

Чацкий

Пусть я посватаюсь, вы что бы мне сказали?

Фамусов

Сказал бы я: во-первых, не блажи,

Именьем, брат, не управляй оплошно,

А, главное, поди-тка послужи.

Чацкий

Служить бы рад, прислуживаться тошно.

Фамусов

Вот то-то, все вы гордецы!

Спросили бы, как делали отцы?

Учились бы, на старших глядя:

Мы, например, или покойник дядя,

Максим Петрович: он не то на серебре,

На золоте едал; сто человек к услугам;

Весь в орденах; езжал-то вечно цугом;

Век при дворе, да при каком дворе!

Тогда не то, что ныне,

При государыне служил Екатерине.

А в те поры все важны! в сорок пуд…

Раскланяйся – тупеем не кивнут.

Вельможа в случае – тем паче:

Не как другой, и пил и ел иначе.

А дядя! что твой князь? что граф?

Сурьезный взгляд, надменный нрав.

Когда же надо подслужиться,

И он сгибался вперегиб:

На ку́ртаге ему случилось обступиться;

Упал, да так, что чуть затылка не пришиб;

Старик заохал, голос хрипкой;

Был высочайшею пожалован улыбкой;

Изволили смеяться; как же он?

Привстал, оправился, хотел отдать поклон,

Упал вдруго́рядь – уж нарочно,

А хохот пуще, он и в третий так же точно.

А? как по-вашему? по-нашему – смышлен.

Упал он больно, встал здорово.

Зато, бывало, в вист кто чаще приглашен?

Кто слышит при дворе приветливое слово?

Максим Петрович! Кто пред всеми знал почет?

Максим Петрович! Шутка!

В чины выводит кто и пенсии дает?

Максим Петрович! Да! Вы, нынешние, – ну-ка!

Чацкий

И точно, начал свет глупеть,

Сказать вы можете вздохнувши;

Как посравнить, да посмотреть

Век нынешний и век минувший:

Свежо предание, а верится с трудом;

Как тот и славился, чья чаще гнулась шея;

Как не в войне, а в мире брали лбом,

Стучали об пол не жалея!

Кому нужда: тем спесь, лежи они в пыли,

А тем, кто выше, лесть как кружево плели.

Прямой был век покорности и страха,

Всё под личиною усердия к царю.

Я не об дядюшке об вашем говорю;

Его не возмутим мы праха:

Но между тем кого охота заберет,

Хоть в раболепстве самом пылком,

Теперь, чтобы смешить народ,

Отважно жертвовать затылком?

А сверстничек, а старичок

Иной, глядя на тот скачок

И разрушаясь в ветхой коже,

Чай, приговаривал: – Ах! если бы мне тоже!

Хоть есть охотники поподличать везде,

Да нынче смех страшит, и держит стыд в узде;

Недаром жалуют их скупо государи.

Фамусов

Ах! боже мой! он карбонари!

Чацкий

Нет, нынче свет уж не таков.

Фамусов

Опасный человек!

Чацкий

Вольнее всякий дышит

И не торопится вписаться в полк шутов.

Фамусов

Что говорит! и говорит, как пишет!

Чацкий

У покровителей зевать на потолок,

Явиться помолчать, пошаркать, пообедать,

Подставить стул, поднять платок.

Фамусов

Он вольность хочет проповедать!

Чацкий

Кто путешествует, в деревне кто живет…

Фамусов

Да он властей не признает!

Чацкий

Кто служит делу, а не лицам…

Фамусов

Строжайше б запретил я этим господам

На выстрел подъезжать к столицам.

Чацкий

Я наконец вам отдых дам…

Фамусов

Терпенья, мочи нет, досадно.

Чацкий

Ваш век бранил я беспощадно,

Предоставляю вам во власть:

Откиньте часть,

Хоть нашим временам в придачу;

Уж так и быть, я не поплачу.

Фамусов

И знать вас не хочу, разврата не терплю.

Чацкий

Я досказал.

Фамусов

Добро, заткнул я уши.

Чацкий

На что ж? я их не оскорблю.

Фамусов (скороговоркой)

Вот рыскают по свету, бьют баклуши,

Воротятся, от них порядка жди.

Чацкий

Я перестал…

Фамусов

Пожалуй, пощади.

Чацкий

Длить споры не мое желанье.

Фамусов

Хоть душу отпусти на покаянье!

Явление 3

Слуга (входит)

Полковник Скалозуб.

Фамусов

(ничего не видит и не слышит)

Тебя уж упекут

Под суд, как пить дадут.

Чацкий

Пожаловал к вам кто-то на́ дом.

Фамусов

Не слушаю, под суд!

Чацкий

К вам человек с докладом.

Фамусов

Не слушаю, под суд! под суд!

Чацкий

Да обернитесь, вас зовут.

Фамусов (оборачивается)

А? бунт? ну так и жду содома.

Слуга

Полковник Скалозуб. Прикажете принять?

Фамусов (встает)

Ослы! сто раз вам повторять?

Принять его, позвать, просить, сказать, что дома,

Что очень рад. Пошел же, торопись.

(Слуга уходит.)

Пожало-ста, сударь, при нем остерегись:

Известный человек, солидный,

И знаков тьму отличья нахватал;

Не по летам и чин завидный,

Не нынче завтра генерал.

Пожало-ста при нем веди себя скромненько…

Эх! Александр Андреич, дурно, брат!

Ко мне он жалует частенько;

Я всякому, ты знаешь, рад;

В Москве прибавят вечно втрое:

Вот будто женится на Сонюшке. Пустое!

Он, может быть, и рад бы был душой,

Да надобности сам не вижу я большой

Дочь выдавать ни завтра, ни сегодня;

Ведь Софья молода. А впрочем, власть господня.

Пожало-ста при нем не спорь ты вкривь и вкось

И завиральные идеи эти брось.

Однако нет его! какую бы причину…

А! знать, ко мне пошел в другую половину.

(Поспешно уходит.)

Явление 4

Чацкий

Как суетится! что за прыть!

А Софья? – Нет ли впрямь тут жениха какого?

С которых пор меня дичатся как чужого!

Как здесь бы ей не быть!!..

Кто этот Скалозуб? отец им сильно бредит,

А может быть не только, что отец…

Ах! тот скажи любви конец,

Кто на три года вдаль уедет.

Явление 5

Чацкий , Фамусов , Скалозуб .

Фамусов

Сергей Сергеич, к нам сюда-с.

Прошу покорно, здесь теплее;

Прозябли вы, согреем вас;

Отдушничек отве́рнем поскорее.

Скалозуб (густым басом)

Зачем же лазить, например,

Самим!.. Мне совестно, как честный офицер.

Фамусов

Неужто для друзей не делать мне ни шагу,

Сергей Сергеич, дорогой!

Кладите шляпу, сденьте шпагу;

Вот вам софа, раскиньтесь на покой.

Скалозуб

Куда прикажете, лишь только бы усесться.

(Садятся все трое, Чацкий поодаль.)

Фамусов

Ах! батюшка, сказать, чтоб не забыть:

Позвольте нам своими счесться,

Хоть дальними, – наследства не делить;

Не знали вы, а я подавно, —

Спасибо научил двоюродный ваш брат, —

Как вам доводится Настасья Николавна?

Скалозуб

Не знаю-с, виноват;

Мы с нею вместе не служили,

Фамусов

Сергей Сергеич, это вы ли!

Нет! я перед родней, где встретится, ползком;

Сыщу ее на дне морском.

При мне служа́щие чужие очень редки;

Всё больше сестрины, свояченицы детки;

Один Молчалин мне не свой,

И то затем, что деловой.

Как станешь представлять к крестишку ли,

к местечку,

Ну как не порадеть родному человечку!..

Однако братец ваш мне друг и говорил,

Что вами выгод тьму по службе получил.

Скалозуб

В тринадцатом году мы отличались с братом

В тридцатом егерском, а после в сорок пятом.

Фамусов

Да, счастье, у кого есть эдакий сынок!

Имеет, кажется, в петличке орденок?

Скалозуб

За третье августа; засели мы в траншею:

Ему дан с бантом, мне на шею.

Фамусов

Любезный человек, и посмотреть – так хват,

Прекрасный человек двоюродный ваш брат.

Скалозуб

Но крепко набрался каких-то новых правил.

Чин следовал ему: он службу вдруг оставил,

В деревне книги стал читать.

Фамусов

Вот молодость!.. – читать!.. а после хвать!..

Вы повели себя исправно,

Давно полковники, а служите недавно.

Скалозуб

Довольно счастлив я в товарищах моих,

Вакансии как раз открыты;

То старших выключат иных,

Другие, смотришь, перебиты.

Фамусов

Да, чем кого господь поищет, вознесет!

Скалозуб

Бывает, моего счастливее везет.

У нас в пятнадцатой дивизии, не дале,

Об нашем хоть сказать бригадном генерале.

Фамусов

Помилуйте, а вам чего недостает?

Скалозуб

Не жалуюсь, не обходили,

Однако за полком два года поводили.

Фамусов

В погонь ли за полком?

Зато, конечно, в чем другом

За вами далеко тянуться.

Скалозуб

Нет-с, ста́рее меня по корпусу найдутся,

Я с восемьсот девятого служу;

Да, чтоб чины добыть, есть многие каналы;

Об них как истинный философ я сужу:

Мне только бы досталось в генералы.

Фамусов

И славно судите, дай бог здоровье вам

И генеральский чин; а там

Зачем откладывать бы дальше

Речь завести об генеральше?

Скалозуб

Жениться? Я ничуть не прочь.

Фамусов

Что ж? у кого сестра, племянница есть, дочь;

В Москве ведь нет невестам перевода;

Чего? плодятся год от года;

А, батюшка, признайтесь, что едва

Где сыщется столица, как Москва.

Скалозуб

Дистанции огромного размера.

Фамусов

Вкус, батюшка, отменная манера;

На всё свои законы есть:

Вот, например, у нас уж исстари ведется,

Что по отцу и сыну честь;

Будь плохенький, да если наберется

Душ тысячки две родовых, —

Тот и жених.

Другой хоть прытче будь, надутый всяким

чванством,

Пускай себе разумником слыви,

А в се́мью не включат. На нас не подиви.

Ведь только здесь еще и дорожат дворянством.

Да это ли одно? возьмите вы хлеб-соль:

Кто хочет к нам пожаловать, – изволь;

Дверь отперта для званых и незваных,

Особенно из иностранных;

Хоть честный человек, хоть нет,

Для нас равнёхонько, про всех готов обед.

Возьмите вы от головы до пяток,

На всех московских есть особый отпечаток.

Извольте посмотреть на нашу молодежь,

На юношей – сынков и вну́чат,

Журим мы их, а, если разберешь, —

В пятнадцать лет учителей научат!

А наши старички?? – Как их возьмет задор,

Засудят об делах, что слово – приговор, —

Ведь столбовые всё, в ус никого не дуют;

И об правительстве иной раз так толкуют,

Что если б кто подслушал их… беда!

Не то чтоб новизны вводили, – никогда,

Спаси нас боже! Нет. А придерутся

К тому, к сему, а чаще ни к чему,

Поспорят, пошумят и… разойдутся.

Прямые канцлеры в отставке – по уму!

Я вам скажу, знать, время не приспело,

Но что без них не обойдется дело. —

А дамы? – сунься кто, попробуй, овладей;

Судьи́ всему, везде, над ними нет судей;

За картами когда восстанут общим бунтом,

Дай бог терпение, – ведь сам я был женат.

Скомандовать велите перед фрунтом!

Присутствовать пошлите их в Сенат!

Ирина Власьевна! Лукерья Алексевна!

Татьяна Юрьевна! Пульхерия Андревна!

А дочек кто видал, – всяк голову повесь…

Его величество король был прусский здесь,

Дивился не путем московским он девицам,

Их благонравью, а не лицам;

И точно, можно ли воспитаннее быть!

Умеют же себя принарядить

Тафтицей, бархатцем и дымкой,

Словечка в простоте не скажут, всё с ужимкой;

Французские романсы вам поют

И верхние выводят нотки,

К военным людям так и льнут,

А потому, что патриотки.

Решительно скажу: едва

Другая сыщется столица как Москва.

Скалозуб

По моему сужденью,

Пожар способствовал ей много к украшенью.

Фамусов

Не поминайте нам, уж мало ли крехтят!

С тех пор дороги, тротуары,

Дома и всё на новый лад.

Чацкий

Дома новы́, но предрассудки стары.

Порадуйтесь, не истребят

Ни годы их, ни моды, ни пожары.

Фамусов (Чацкому)

Эй, завяжи на память узелок;

Просил я помолчать, не велика услуга.

(Скалозубу)

Позвольте, батюшка. Вот-с – Чацкого, мне друга,

Андрея Ильича покойного сынок:

Не служит, то есть в том он пользы не находит,

Но захоти – так был бы деловой.

Жаль, очень жаль, он малый с головой

И славно пишет, переводит.

Нельзя не пожалеть, что с эдаким умом…

Чацкий

Нельзя ли пожалеть об ком-нибудь другом?

И похвалы мне ваши досаждают.

Фамусов

Не я один, все так же осуждают.

Чацкий

А судьи кто? – За древностию лет

К свободной жизни их вражда непримирима,

Сужденья черпают из забыты́х газет

Времен Очаковских и покоренья Крыма;

Всегда готовые к журьбе,

Поют всё песнь одну и ту же,

Не замечая об себе:

Что старее, то хуже.

Где, укажите нам, отечества отцы,

Которых мы должны принять за образцы?

Не эти ли, грабительством богаты?

Защиту от суда в друзьях нашли, в родстве,

Великолепные соорудя палаты,

Где разливаются в пирах и мотовстве

И где не воскресят клиенты-иностранцы

Прошедшего житья подлейшие черты.

Да и кому в Москве не зажимали рты

Обеды, ужины и танцы?

Не тот ли вы, к кому меня еще с пелён,

Для замыслов каких-то непонятных,

Дитёй возили на поклон?

Тот Нестор негодяев знатных,

Толпою окруженный слуг;

Усердствуя, они в часы вина и драки

И честь и жизнь его не раз спасали: вдруг

На них он выменил борзые три собаки!!!

Или вон тот еще, который для затей

На крепостной балет согнал на многих фурах

От матерей, отцов отторженных детей?!

Сам погружен умом в Зефирах и в Амурах,

Заставил всю Москву дивиться их красе!

Но должников не согласил к отсрочке:

Амуры и Зефиры все

Распроданы поодиночке!!!

Вот те, которые дожи́ли до седин!

Вот уважать кого должны мы на безлюдьи!

Вот наши строгие ценители и судьи!

Теперь пускай из нас один,

Из молодых людей, найдется – враг исканий,

Не требуя ни мест, ни повышенья в чин,

В науки он вперит ум, алчущий познаний;

Или в душе его сам бог возбудит жар

К искусствам творческим, высоким

и прекрасным, —

Они тотчас: разбой! пожар!

И прослывет у них мечтателем! опасным!! —

Мундир! один мундир! он в прежнем их быту

Когда-то укрывал, расшитый и красивый,

Их слабодушие, рассудка нищету;

И нам за ними в путь счастливый!

И в женах, дочерях – к мундиру та же страсть!

Я сам к нему давно ль от нежности отрекся?!

Теперь уж в это мне ребячество не впасть;

Но кто б тогда за всеми не повлекся?

Когда из гвардии, иные от двора

Сюда на время приезжали, —

Кричали женщины: ура!

И в воздух чепчики бросали!

Фамусов (про себя)

Уж втянет он меня в беду.

(Громко.)

Сергей Сергеич, я пойду

И буду ждать вас в кабинете.

(Уходит.)

Явление 6

Скалозуб

Мне нравится, при этой смете

Искусно как коснулись вы

Предубеждения Москвы

К любимцам, к гвардии, к гвардейским,

к гвардионцам;

Их золоту, шитью дивятся будто солнцам!

А в Первой армии когда отстали? в чем?

Всё так прилажено, и тальи все так узки,

И офицеров вам начтём,

Что даже говорят, иные, по-французски.

Ах! боже мой! упал, убился!

(Теряет чувства.)

Чацкий

Кто?

Кто это?

Скалозуб

С кем беда?

Чацкий

Она мертва со страху!

Скалозуб

Да кто? откудова?

Чацкий

Ушибся обо что?

Скалозуб

Уж не старик ли наш дал маху?

Лиза (хлопочет около барышни)

Кому назначено-с, не миновать судьбы:

Молчалин на́ лошадь садился, ногу в стремя,

А лошадь на дыбы,

Он об землю и прямо в темя.

Скалозуб

Поводья затянул. Ну, жалкий же ездок.

Взглянуть, как треснулся он – грудью или в бок?

(Уходит.)

Явление 8

Те же без Скалозуба.

Чацкий

Помочь ей чем? Скажи скорее.

Лиза

Там в комнате вода стоит.

( Чацкий бежит и приносит. Всё следующее – вполголоса, – до того, как София очнется.)

Стакан налейте.

Чацкий

Уж налит.

Шнуровку отпусти вольнее,

Виски ей уксусом потри,

Опрыскивай водой. – Смотри:

Свободнее дыханье стало.

Повеять чем?

Лиза

Вот опахало.

Чацкий

Гляди в окно:

Молчалин на ногах давно!

Безделица ее тревожит.

Лиза

Да-с, барышнин несчастен нрав:

Со стороны смотреть не может,

Как люди падают стремглав.

Чацкий

Опрыскивай еще водою.

Вот так. Еще. Еще.

София (с глубоким вздохом)

Кто здесь со мною?

Я точно как во сне.

(Торопко и громко.)

Где он? что с ним? Скажите мне.

Чацкий

Пускай себе сломил бы шею,

Вас чуть было не уморил.

София

Убийственны холодностью своею!

Смотреть на вас, вас слушать нету сил.

Чацкий

Прикажете мне за него терзаться?

София

Туда бежать, там быть, помочь ему стараться.

Чацкий

Чтоб оставались вы без помощи одне?

София

На что вы мне?

Да, правда, не свои беды́ – для вас забавы,

Отец родной убейся – всё равно.

(Лизе.)

Пойдем туда, бежим.

Лиза (отводит ее в сторону)

Опомнитесь! куда вы?

Он жив, здоров, смотрите здесь в окно.

( София в окошко высовывается. )

Чацкий

Смятенье! обморок! поспешность! гнев! испуга!

Так можно только ощущать,

Когда лишаешься единственного друга.

София

Сюда идут. Руки не может он поднять.

Чацкий

Желал бы с ним убиться…

Лиза

Для компаньи?

София

Нет, оставайтесь при желаньи.

Явление 9

София , Лиза , Чацкий , Скалозуб , Молчалин (с подвязанною рукою).

Воскрес и невредим, рука

Ушибена слегка,

И впрочем, всё фальшивая тревога.

Молчалин

Я вас перепугал, простите ради бога.

Скалозуб

Ну! я не знал, что будет из того

Вам ирритация. Опро́метью вбежали. —

Мы вздрогнули! – Вы в обморок упали,

И что ж? – весь страх из ничего.

София (не глядя ни на кого)

Ах! очень вижу: из пустого,

А вся еще теперь дрожу.

Чацкий (про себя)

С Молчалиным ни слова!

София

Однако о себе скажу,

Что не труслива. Так, бывает,

Карета свалится, – подымут: я опять

Готова сызнова скакать;

Но всё малейшее в других меня пугает,

Хоть нет великого несчастья от того,

Хоть незнакомый мне, – до этого нет дела.

Чацкий (про себя)

Прощенья просит у него,

Что раз о ком-то пожалела!

Скалозуб

Позвольте, расскажу вам весть:

Княгиня Ласова какая-то здесь есть,

Наездница, вдова, но нет примеров,

Чтоб ездило с ней много кавалеров.

На днях расшиблась в пух, —

Жоке́ не поддержал, считал он, видно, мух. —

И без того она, как слышно, неуклюжа,

Теперь ребра недостает,

Так для поддержки ищет мужа.

София

Ах, Александр Андреич, вот —

Яви́тесь вы вполне великодушны:

К несчастью ближнего вы так неравнодушны.

Чацкий

Да-с, это я сейчас явил

Моим усерднейшим стараньем,

И прысканьем, и оттираньем;

Не знаю для кого, но вас я воскресил.

(Берет шляпу и уходит.)

Вы вечером к нам будете?

Скалозуб

Как рано?

София

Пораньше; съедутся домашние друзья

Потанцовать под фортопияно, —

Мы в трауре, так балу дать нельзя.

Скалозуб

Явлюсь, но к батюшке зайти я обещался,

Откланяюсь.

София

Прощайте.

Скалозуб (жмет руку Молчалину)

Ваш слуга.

София

Молчалин! как во мне рассудок цел остался!

Ведь знаете, как жизнь мне ваша дорога!

Зачем же ей играть, и так неосторожно?

Скажите, что у вас с рукой?

Не дать ли капель вам? не нужен ли покой?

Пошлемте к доктору, пренебрегать не должно.

Молчалин

Платком перевязал, не больно мне с тех пор.

Лиза

Ударюсь об заклад, что вздор;

И если б не к лицу, не нужно перевязки;

А то не вздор, что вам не избежать огласки:

На смех, того гляди, подымет Чацкий вас;

И Скалозуб как свой хохол закру́тит,

Расскажет обморок, прибавит сто прикрас;

Шутить и он горазд, ведь нынче кто не шутит!

София

А кем из них я дорожу?

Хочу – люблю, хочу – скажу.

Молчалин! будто я себя не принуждала?

Вошли вы, слова не сказала,

При них не смела я дохнуть,

У вас спросить, на вас взглянуть.

Молчалин

Нет, Софья Павловна, вы слишком откровенны.

София

Откуда скрытность почерпнуть!

Готова я была в окошко, к вам прыгну́ть.

Да что мне до кого? до них? до всей вселенны?

Смешно? – пусть шутят их; досадно? – пусть бранят.

Молчалин

Не повредила бы нам откровенность эта.

София

Неужто на дуэль вас вызвать захотят?

Молчалин

Ах! злые языки страшнее пистолета.

Лиза

Сидят они у батюшки теперь,

Вот кабы вы порхнули в дверь

С лицом веселым, беззаботно:

Когда нам скажут, что хотим, —

Куда как верится охотно!

И Александр Андреич, – с ним

О прежних днях, о тех проказах

Поразвернитесь-ка в рассказах:

Улыбочка и пара слов,

И кто влюблен – на всё готов.

Молчалин

Я вам советовать не смею.

(Целует ей руку.)

Прошу подальше руки!

Молчалин

Есть у меня вещицы три:

Есть туалет, прехитрая работа —

Кругом всё прорезь, позолота;

Подушечка, из бисера узор;

И перламутровый прибор —

Игольничек и ножинки, как милы!

Жемчужинки, растертые в белилы!

Помада есть для губ и для других причин,

С духами сткляночки: резе́да и жасмин.

Скажите лучше, почему

Вы с барышней скромны, а с горнишной повесы?

Дождусь ее и вынужу признанье:

Кто наконец ей мил? Молчалин! Скалозуб!

Молчалин прежде был так глуп!..

Жалчайшее созданье!

Уж разве поумнел?.. А тот —

Хрипун, удавленник, фагот,

Созвездие манёвров и мазурки!

Судьба любви – играть ей в жмурки,

А мне…

Входит София.

Вы здесь? я очень рад,

Я этого желал.

София (про себя)

И очень невпопад.

Чацкий

Конечно, не меня искали?

София

Я не искала вас.

Хоть и некстати, ну́жды нет:

София

Ах! боже мой! весь свет.

Чацкий

София

Есть многие, родные.

Чацкий

Все более меня?

София

Иные.

И я чего хочу, когда всё решено?

Мне в пе́тлю лезть, а ей смешно.

София

Хотите ли знать истины два слова?

Малейшая в ком странность чуть видна,

Веселость ваша не скромна,

У вас тотчас уж острота́ готова,

А сами вы…

Чацкий

Я сам? не правда ли, смешон?

София

Да! грозный взгляд, и резкий тон,

И этих в вас особенностей бездна;

А над собой гроза куда не бесполезна.

Чацкий

Я странен, а не странен кто ж?

Тот, кто на всех глупцов похож;

Молчалин, например…

София

Примеры мне не новы;

Заметно, что вы желчь на всех излить готовы;

А я, чтоб не мешать, отсюда уклонюсь.

Чацкий (держит ее)

Постойте же.

(В сторону.)

Раз в жизни притворюсь.

(Громко.)

Оставимте мы эти пренья,

Перед Молчалиным не прав я, виноват;

Быть может, он не то, что три года назад:

Есть на земле такие превращенья

Правлений, климатов, и нравов, и умов;

Есть люди важные, слыли за дураков:

Иной по армии, иной плохим поэтом,

Иной… Боюсь назвать, но признаны всем светом,

Особенно в последние года,

Что стали умны хоть куда.

Пускай в Молчалине ум бойкий, гений смелый,

Но есть ли в нем та страсть? то чувство? пылкость та?

Чтоб кроме вас ему мир целый

Казался прах и суета?

Чтоб сердца каждое биенье

Любовью ускорялось к вам?

Чтоб мыслям были всем и всем его делам

Душою – вы, вам угожденье?..

Сам это чувствую, сказать я не могу,

Но что теперь во мне кипит, волнует, бесит,

Не пожелал бы я и личному врагу,

А он?.. смолчит и голову повесит.

Конечно, смирен, все такие не резвы́;

Бог знает, в нем какая тайна скрыта;

Бог знает, за него что выдумали вы,

Чем голова его ввек не была набита.

Быть может, качеств ваших тьму,

Любуясь им, вы придали ему;

Не грешен он ни в чем, вы во сто раз грешнее.

Нет! нет! пускай умен, час от часу умнее,

Но вас он сто́ит ли? вот вам один вопрос.

Чтоб равнодушнее мне понести утрату,

Как человеку вы, который с вами взрос,

Как другу вашему, как брату,

Мне дайте убедиться в том;

Потом

От сумасшествия могу я остеречься;

Пущусь подалее простыть, охолодеть,

Не думать о любви, но буду я уметь

Теряться по́ свету, забыться и развлечься.

София (про себя)

Вот нехотя с ума свела!

(Вслух.)

Что притворяться?

Молчалин давеча мог без руки остаться,

Я живо в нем участье приняла;

А вы, случась на эту пору,

Не позаботились расчесть,

Что можно доброй быть ко всем и без разбору;

Но, может, истина в догадках ваших есть,

И горячо его беру я под защиту:

Зачем же быть, скажу вам напрямик,

Так невоздержну на язык?

В презреньи к людям так нескрыту?

Что и смирнейшему пощады нет!.. чего?

Случись кому назвать его:

Град колкостей и шуток ваших грянет.

Шутить! и век шутить! как вас на это станет!

Чацкий

Ах! боже мой! неужли я из тех,

Которым цель всей жизни – смех?

Мне весело, когда смешных встречаю,

А чаще с ними я скучаю.

София

Напрасно: это всё относится к другим,

Молчалин вам наскучил бы едва ли,

Когда б сошлись короче с ним.

Чацкий (с жаром)

Зачем же вы его так коротко узнали?

София

Я не старалась, бог нас свел.

Смотрите, дружбу всех он в доме приобрел:

При батюшке три года служит,

Тот часто бе́з толку сердит,

А он безмолвием его обезоружит,

От доброты души простит.

И между прочим,

Веселостей искать бы мог;

Ничуть: от старичков не ступит за порог;

Мы ре́звимся, хохочем,

Он с ними целый день засядет, рад не рад,

Играет…

Чацкий

Целый день играет!

Молчит, когда его бранят!

(В сторону.)

Она его не уважает.

София

Конечно, нет в нем этого ума,

Что гений для иных, а для иных чума,

Который скор, блестящ и скоро опротивит,

Который свет ругает наповал,

Чтоб свет об нем хоть что-нибудь сказал;

Да эдакий ли ум семейство осчастливит?

Чацкий

Сатира и мораль – смысл этого всего?

(В сторону.)

Она не ставит в грош его.

София

Чудеснейшего свойства

Он наконец: уступчив, скромен, тих,

В лице ни тени беспокойства

И на душе проступков никаких,

Чужих и вкривь и вкось не рубит, —

Вот я за что его люблю.

Чацкий (в сторону)

Шалит, она его не любит.

To the door of an inn in the provincial town of N. there drew up a smart britchka—a light spring-carriage of the sort affected by bachelors, retired lieutenant-colonels, staff-captains, land-owners possessed of about a hundred souls, and, in short, all persons who rank as gentlemen of the intermediate category. In the britchka was seated such a gentleman—a man who, though not handsome, was not ill-favoured, not over-fat, and not over-thin. Also, though not over-elderly, he was not over-young. His arrival produced no stir in the town, and was accompanied by no particular incident, beyond that a couple of peasants who happened to be standing at the door of a dramshop exchanged a few comments with reference to the equipage rather than to the individual who was seated in it. “Look at that carriage,” one of them said to the other. “Think you it will be going as far as Moscow?” “I think it will,” replied his companion. “But not as far as Kazan, eh?” “No, not as far as Kazan.” With that the conversation ended. Presently, as the britchka was approaching the inn, it was met by a young man in a pair of very short, very tight breeches of white dimity, a quasi-fashionable frockcoat, and a dickey fastened with a pistol-shaped bronze tie-pin. The young man turned his head as he passed the britchka and eyed it attentively; after which he clapped his hand to his cap (which was in danger of being removed by the wind) and resumed his way. On the vehicle reaching the inn door, its occupant found standing there to welcome him the polevoi, or waiter, of the establishment—an individual of such nimble and brisk movement that even to distinguish the character of his face was impossible. Running out with a napkin in one hand and his lanky form clad in a tailcoat, reaching almost to the nape of his neck, he tossed back his locks, and escorted the gentleman upstairs, along a wooden gallery, and so to the bedchamber which God had prepared for the gentleman’s reception. The said bedchamber was of quite ordinary appearance, since the inn belonged to the species to be found in all provincial towns—the species wherein, for two roubles a day, travellers may obtain a room swarming with black-beetles, and communicating by a doorway with the apartment adjoining. True, the doorway may be blocked up with a wardrobe; yet behind it, in all probability, there will be standing a silent, motionless neighbour whose ears are burning to learn every possible detail concerning the latest arrival. The inn’s exterior corresponded with its interior. Long, and consisting only of two storeys, the building had its lower half destitute of stucco; with the result that the dark-red bricks, originally more or less dingy, had grown yet dingier under the influence of atmospheric changes. As for the upper half of the building, it was, of course, painted the usual tint of unfading yellow. Within, on the ground floor, there stood a number of benches heaped with horse-collars, rope, and sheepskins; while the window-seat accommodated a sbitentshik 4, cheek by jowl with a samovar 5—the latter so closely resembling the former in appearance that, but for the fact of the samovar possessing a pitch-black lip, the samovar and the sbitentshik might have been two of a pair.

During the traveller’s inspection of his room his luggage was brought into the apartment. First came a portmanteau of white leather whose raggedness indicated that the receptacle had made several previous journeys. The bearers of the same were the gentleman’s coachman, Selifan (a little man in a large overcoat), and the gentleman’s valet, Petrushka—the latter a fellow of about thirty, clad in a worn, over-ample jacket which formerly had graced his master’s shoulders, and possessed of a nose and a pair of lips whose coarseness communicated to his face rather a sullen expression. Behind the portmanteau came a small dispatch-box of redwood, lined with birch bark, a boot-case, and (wrapped in blue paper) a roast fowl; all of which having been deposited, the coachman departed to look after his horses, and the valet to establish himself in the little dark anteroom or kennel where already he had stored a cloak, a bagful of livery, and his own peculiar smell. Pressing the narrow bedstead back against the wall, he covered it with the tiny remnant of mattress—a remnant as thin and flat (perhaps also as greasy) as a pancake—which he had managed to beg of the landlord of the establishment.

While the attendants had been thus setting things straight the gentleman had repaired to the common parlour. The appearance of common parlours of the kind is known to every one who travels. Always they have varnished walls which, grown black in their upper portions with tobacco smoke, are, in their lower, grown shiny with the friction of customers’ backs—more especially with that of the backs of such local tradesmen as, on market-days, make it their regular practice to resort to the local hostelry for a glass of tea. Also, parlours of this kind invariably contain smutty ceilings, an equally smutty chandelier, a number of pendent shades which jump and rattle whenever the waiter scurries across the shabby oilcloth with a trayful of glasses (the glasses looking like a flock of birds roosting by the seashore), and a selection of oil paintings. In short, there are certain objects which one sees in every inn. In the present case the only outstanding feature of the room was the fact that in one of the paintings a nymph was portrayed as possessing breasts of a size such as the reader can never in his life have beheld. A similar caricaturing of nature is to be noted in the historical pictures (of unknown origin, period, and creation) which reach us—sometimes through the instrumentality of Russian magnates who profess to be connoisseurs of art—from Italy; owing to the said magnates having made such purchases solely on the advice of the couriers who have escorted them.

To resume, however—our traveller removed his cap, and divested his neck of a parti-coloured woollen scarf of the kind which a wife makes for her husband with her own hands, while accompanying the gift with interminable injunctions as to how best such a garment ought to be folded. True, bachelors also wear similar gauds, but, in their case, God alone knows who may have manufactured the articles! For my part, I cannot endure them. Having unfolded the scarf, the gentleman ordered dinner, and whilst the various dishes were being got ready—cabbage soup, a pie several weeks old, a dish of marrow and peas, a dish of sausages and cabbage, a roast fowl, some salted cucumber, and the sweet tart which stands perpetually ready for use in such establishments; whilst, I say, these things were either being warmed up or brought in cold, the gentleman induced the waiter to retail certain fragments of tittle-tattle concerning the late landlord of the hostelry, the amount of income which the hostelry produced, and the character of its present proprietor. To the last-mentioned inquiry the waiter returned the answer invariably given in such cases—namely, “My master is a terribly hard man, sir.” Curious that in enlightened Russia so many people cannot even take a meal at an inn without chattering to the attendant and making free with him! Nevertheless not ALL the questions which the gentleman asked were aimless ones, for he inquired who was Governor of the town, who President of the Local Council, and who Public Prosecutor. In short, he omitted no single official of note, while asking also (though with an air of detachment) the most exact particulars concerning the landowners of the neighbourhood. Which of them, he inquired, possessed serfs, and how many of them? How far from the town did those landowners reside? What was the character of each landowner, and was he in the habit of paying frequent visits to the town? The gentleman also made searching inquiries concerning the hygienic condition of the countryside. Was there, he asked, much sickness about—whether sporadic fever, fatal forms of ague, smallpox, or what not? Yet, though his solicitude concerning these matters showed more than ordinary curiosity, his bearing retained its gravity unimpaired, and from time to time he blew his nose with portentous fervour. Indeed, the manner in which he accomplished this latter feat was marvellous in the extreme, for, though that member emitted sounds equal to those of a trumpet in intensity, he could yet, with his accompanying air of guileless dignity, evoke the waiter’s undivided respect—so much so that, whenever the sounds of the nose reached that menial’s ears, he would shake back his locks, straighten himself into a posture of marked solicitude, and inquire afresh, with head slightly inclined, whether the gentleman happened to require anything further. After dinner the guest consumed a cup of coffee, and then, seating himself upon the sofa, with, behind him, one of those wool-covered cushions which, in Russian taverns, resemble nothing so much as a cobblestone or a brick, fell to snoring; whereafter, returning with a start to consciousness, he ordered himself to be conducted to his room, flung himself at full length upon the bed, and once more slept soundly for a couple of hours. Aroused, eventually, by the waiter, he, at the latter’s request, inscribed a fragment of paper with his name, his surname, and his rank (for communication, in accordance with the law, to the police): and on that paper the waiter, leaning forward from the corridor, read, syllable by syllable: “Paul Ivanovitch Chichikov, Collegiate Councillor—Landowner—Travelling on Private Affairs.” The waiter had just time to accomplish this feat before Paul Ivanovitch Chichikov set forth to inspect the town. Apparently the place succeeded in satisfying him, and, to tell the truth, it was at least up to the usual standard of our provincial capitals. Where the staring yellow of stone edifices did not greet his eye he found himself confronted with the more modest grey of wooden ones; which, consisting, for the most part, of one or two storeys (added to the range of attics which provincial architects love so well), looked almost lost amid the expanses of street and intervening medleys of broken or half-finished partition-walls. At other points evidence of more life and movement was to be seen, and here the houses stood crowded together and displayed dilapidated, rain-blurred signboards whereon boots or cakes or pairs of blue breeches inscribed “Arshavski, Tailor,” and so forth, were depicted. Over a shop containing hats and caps was written “Vassili Thedorov, Foreigner”; while, at another spot, a signboard portrayed a billiard table and two players—the latter clad in frockcoats of the kind usually affected by actors whose part it is to enter the stage during the closing act of a piece, even though, with arms sharply crooked and legs slightly bent, the said billiard players were taking the most careful aim, but succeeding only in making abortive strokes in the air. Each emporium of the sort had written over it: “This is the best establishment of its kind in the town.” Also, al fresco in the streets there stood tables heaped with nuts, soap, and gingerbread (the latter but little distinguishable from the soap), and at an eating-house there was displayed the sign of a plump fish transfixed with a gaff. But the sign most frequently to be discerned was the insignia of the State, the double-headed eagle (now replaced, in this connection, with the laconic inscription “Dramshop”). As for the paving of the town, it was uniformly bad.

The gentleman peered also into the municipal gardens, which contained only a few sorry trees that were poorly selected, requiring to be propped with oil-painted, triangular green supports, and able to boast of a height no greater than that of an ordinary walking-stick. Yet recently the local paper had said (apropos of a gala) that, “Thanks to the efforts of our Civil Governor, the town has become enriched with a pleasaunce full of umbrageous, spaciously-branching trees. Even on the most sultry day they afford agreeable shade, and indeed gratifying was it to see the hearts of our citizens panting with an impulse of gratitude as their eyes shed tears in recognition of all that their Governor has done for them!”

Next, after inquiring of a gendarme as to the best ways and means of finding the local council, the local law-courts, and the local Governor, should he (Chichikov) have need of them, the gentleman went on to inspect the river which ran through the town. En route he tore off a notice affixed to a post, in order that he might the more conveniently read it after his return to the inn. Also, he bestowed upon a lady of pleasant exterior who, escorted by a footman laden with a bundle, happened to be passing along a wooden sidewalk a prolonged stare. Lastly, he threw around him a comprehensive glance (as though to fix in his mind the general topography of the place) and betook himself home. There, gently aided by the waiter, he ascended the stairs to his bedroom, drank a glass of tea, and, seating himself at the table, called for a candle; which having been brought him, he produced from his pocket the notice, held it close to the flame, and conned its tenour—slightly contracting his right eye as he did so. Yet there was little in the notice to call for remark. All that it said was that shortly one of Kotzebue’s 6 plays would be given, and that one of the parts in the play was to be taken by a certain Monsieur Poplevin, and another by a certain Mademoiselle Ziablova, while the remaining parts were to be filled by a number of less important personages. Nevertheless the gentleman perused the notice with careful attention, and even jotted down the prices to be asked for seats for the performance. Also, he remarked that the bill had been printed in the press of the Provincial Government. Next, he turned over the paper, in order to see if anything further was to be read on the reverse side; but, finding nothing there, he refolded the document, placed it in the box which served him as a receptacle for odds and ends, and brought the day to a close with a portion of cold veal, a bottle of pickles, and a sound sleep.

The following day he devoted to paying calls upon the various municipal officials—a first, and a very respectful, visit being paid to the Governor. This personage turned out to resemble Chichikov himself in that he was neither fat nor thin. Also, he wore the riband of the order of Saint Anna about his neck, and was reported to have been recommended also for the star. For the rest, he was large and good-natured, and had a habit of amusing himself with occasional spells of knitting. Next, Chichikov repaired to the Vice-Governor’s, and thence to the house of the Public Prosecutor, to that of the President of the Local Council, to that of the Chief of Police, to that of the Commissioner of Taxes, and to that of the local Director of State Factories. True, the task of remembering every big-wig in this world of ours is not a very easy one; but at least our visitor displayed the greatest activity in his work of paying calls, seeing that he went so far as to pay his respects also to the Inspector of the Municipal Department of Medicine and to the City Architect. Thereafter he sat thoughtfully in his britchka—plunged in meditation on the subject of whom else it might be well to visit. However, not a single magnate had been neglected, and in conversation with his hosts he had contrived to flatter each separate one. For instance to the Governor he had hinted that a stranger, on arriving in his, the Governor’s province, would conceive that he had reached Paradise, so velvety were the roads. “Governors who appoint capable subordinates,” had said Chichikov, “are deserving of the most ample meed of praise.” Again, to the Chief of Police our hero had passed a most gratifying remark on the subject of the local gendarmery; while in his conversation with the Vice-Governor and the President of the Local Council (neither of whom had, as yet, risen above the rank of State Councillor) he had twice been guilty of the gaucherie of addressing his interlocutors with the title of “Your Excellency”—a blunder which had not failed to delight them. In the result the Governor had invited him to a reception the same evening, and certain other officials had followed suit by inviting him, one of them to dinner, a second to a tea-party, and so forth, and so forth.

Of himself, however, the traveller had spoken little; or, if he had spoken at any length, he had done so in a general sort of way and with marked modesty. Indeed, at moments of the kind his discourse had assumed something of a literary vein, in that invariably he had stated that, being a worm of no account in the world, he was deserving of no consideration at the hands of his fellows; that in his time he had undergone many strange experiences; that subsequently he had suffered much in the cause of Truth; that he had many enemies seeking his life; and that, being desirous of rest, he was now engaged in searching for a spot wherein to dwell—wherefore, having stumbled upon the town in which he now found himself, he had considered it his bounden duty to evince his respect for the chief authorities of the place. This, and no more, was all that, for the moment, the town succeeded in learning about the new arrival. Naturally he lost no time in presenting himself at the Governor’s evening party. First, however, his preparations for that function occupied a space of over two hours, and necessitated an attention to his toilet of a kind not commonly seen. That is to say, after a brief post-prandial nap he called for soap and water, and spent a considerable period in the task of scrubbing his cheeks (which, for the purpose, he supported from within with his tongue) and then of drying his full, round face, from the ears downwards, with a towel which he took from the waiter’s shoulder. Twice he snorted into the waiter’s countenance as he did this, and then he posted himself in front of the mirror, donned a false shirt-front, plucked out a couple of hairs which were protruding from his nose, and appeared vested in a frockcoat of bilberry-coloured check. Thereafter driving through broad streets sparsely lighted with lanterns, he arrived at the Governor’s residence to find it illuminated as for a ball. Barouches with gleaming lamps, a couple of gendarmes posted before the doors, a babel of postillions’ cries—nothing of a kind likely to be impressive was wanting; and, on reaching the salon, the visitor actually found himself obliged to close his eyes for a moment, so strong was the mingled sheen of lamps, candles, and feminine apparel. Everything seemed suffused with light, and everywhere, flitting and flashing, were to be seen black coats—even as on a hot summer’s day flies revolve around a sugar loaf while the old housekeeper is cutting it into cubes before the open window, and the children of the house crowd around her to watch the movements of her rugged hands as those members ply the smoking pestle; and airy squadrons of flies, borne on the breeze, enter boldly, as though free of the house, and, taking advantage of the fact that the glare of the sunshine is troubling the old lady’s sight, disperse themselves over broken and unbroken fragments alike, even though the lethargy induced by the opulence of summer and the rich shower of dainties to be encountered at every step has induced them to enter less for the purpose of eating than for that of showing themselves in public, of parading up and down the sugar loaf, of rubbing both their hindquarters and their fore against one another, of cleaning their bodies under the wings, of extending their forelegs over their heads and grooming themselves, and of flying out of the window again to return with other predatory squadrons. Indeed, so dazed was Chichikov that scarcely did he realise that the Governor was taking him by the arm and presenting him to his (the Governor’s) lady. Yet the newly-arrived guest kept his head sufficiently to contrive to murmur some such compliment as might fittingly come from a middle-aged individual of a rank neither excessively high nor excessively low. Next, when couples had been formed for dancing and the remainder of the company found itself pressed back against the walls, Chichikov folded his arms, and carefully scrutinised the dancers. Some of the ladies were dressed well and in the fashion, while the remainder were clad in such garments as God usually bestows upon a provincial town. Also here, as elsewhere, the men belonged to two separate and distinct categories; one of which comprised slender individuals who, flitting around the ladies, were scarcely to be distinguished from denizens of the metropolis, so carefully, so artistically, groomed were their whiskers, so presentable their oval, clean-shaven faces, so easy the manner of their dancing attendance upon their womenfolk, so glib their French conversation as they quizzed their female companions. As for the other category, it comprised individuals who, stout, or of the same build as Chichikov (that is to say, neither very portly nor very lean), backed and sidled away from the ladies, and kept peering hither and thither to see whether the Governor’s footmen had set out green tables for whist. Their features were full and plump, some of them had beards, and in no case was their hair curled or waved or arranged in what the French call “the devil-may-care” style. On the contrary, their heads were either close-cropped or brushed very smooth, and their faces were round and firm. This category represented the more respectable officials of the town. In passing, I may say that in business matters fat men always prove superior to their leaner brethren; which is probably the reason why the latter are mostly to be found in the Political Police, or acting as mere ciphers whose existence is a purely hopeless, airy, trivial one. Again, stout individuals never take a back seat, but always a front one, and, wheresoever it be, they sit firmly, and with confidence, and decline to budge even though the seat crack and bend with their weight. For comeliness of exterior they care not a rap, and therefore a dress coat sits less easily on their figures than is the case with figures of leaner individuals. Yet invariably fat men amass the greater wealth. In three years’ time a thin man will not have a single serf whom he has left unpledged; whereas—well, pray look at a fat man’s fortunes, and what will you see? First of all a suburban villa, and then a larger suburban villa, and then a villa close to a town, and lastly a country estate which comprises every amenity! That is to say, having served both God and the State, the stout individual has won universal respect, and will end by retiring from business, reordering his mode of life, and becoming a Russian landowner—in other words, a fine gentleman who dispenses hospitality, lives in comfort and luxury, and is destined to leave his property to heirs who are purposing to squander the same on foreign travel.

That the foregoing represents pretty much the gist of Chichikov’s reflections as he stood watching the company I will not attempt to deny. And of those reflections the upshot was that he decided to join himself to the stouter section of the guests, among whom he had already recognised several familiar faces—namely, those of the Public Prosecutor (a man with beetling brows over eyes which seemed to be saying with a wink, “Come into the next room, my friend, for I have something to say to you”—though, in the main, their owner was a man of grave and taciturn habit), of the Postmaster (an insignificant-looking individual, yet a would-be wit and a philosopher), and of the President of the Local Council (a man of much amiability and good sense). These three personages greeted Chichikov as an old acquaintance, and to their salutations he responded with a sidelong, yet a sufficiently civil, bow. Also, he became acquainted with an extremely unctuous and approachable landowner named Manilov, and with a landowner of more uncouth exterior named Sobakevitch—the latter of whom began the acquaintance by treading heavily upon Chichikov’s toes, and then begging his pardon. Next, Chichikov received an offer of a “cut in” at whist, and accepted the same with his usual courteous inclination of the head. Seating themselves at a green table, the party did not rise therefrom till supper time; and during that period all conversation between the players became hushed, as is the custom when men have given themselves up to a really serious pursuit. Even the Postmaster—a talkative man by nature—had no sooner taken the cards into his hands than he assumed an expression of profound thought, pursed his lips, and retained this attitude unchanged throughout the game. Only when playing a court card was it his custom to strike the table with his fist, and to exclaim (if the card happened to be a queen), “Now, old popadia 7!” and (if the card happened to be a king), “Now, peasant of Tambov!” To which ejaculations invariably the President of the Local Council retorted, “Ah, I have him by the ears, I have him by the ears!” And from the neighbourhood of the table other strong ejaculations relative to the play would arise, interposed with one or another of those nicknames which participants in a game are apt to apply to members of the various suits. I need hardly add that, the game over, the players fell to quarrelling, and that in the dispute our friend joined, though so artfully as to let every one see that, in spite of the fact that he was wrangling, he was doing so only in the most amicable fashion possible. Never did he say outright, “You played the wrong card at such and such a point.” No, he always employed some such phrase as, “You permitted yourself to make a slip, and thus afforded me the honour of covering your deuce.” Indeed, the better to keep in accord with his antagonists, he kept offering them his silver-enamelled snuff-box (at the bottom of which lay a couple of violets, placed there for the sake of their scent). In particular did the newcomer pay attention to landowners Manilov and Sobakevitch; so much so that his haste to arrive on good terms with them led to his leaving the President and the Postmaster rather in the shade. At the same time, certain questions which he put to those two landowners evinced not only curiosity, but also a certain amount of sound intelligence; for he began by asking how many peasant souls each of them possessed, and how their affairs happened at present to be situated, and then proceeded to enlighten himself also as their standing and their families. Indeed, it was not long before he had succeeded in fairly enchanting his new friends. In particular did Manilov—a man still in his prime, and possessed of a pair of eyes which, sweet as sugar, blinked whenever he laughed—find himself unable to make enough of his enchanter. Clasping Chichikov long and fervently by the hand, he besought him to do him, Manilov, the honour of visiting his country house (which he declared to lie at a distance of not more than fifteen versts from the boundaries of the town); and in return Chichikov averred (with an exceedingly affable bow and a most sincere handshake) that he was prepared not only to fulfil his friend’s behest, but also to look upon the fulfilling of it as a sacred duty. In the same way Sobakevitch said to him laconically: “And do you pay ME a visit,” and then proceeded to shuffle a pair of boots of such dimensions that to find a pair to correspond with them would have been indeed difficult—more especially at the present day, when the race of epic heroes is beginning to die out in Russia.

Next day Chichikov dined and spent the evening at the house of the Chief of Police—a residence where, three hours after dinner, every one sat down to whist, and remained so seated until two o’clock in the morning. On this occasion Chichikov made the acquaintance of, among others, a landowner named Nozdrev—a dissipated little fellow of thirty who had no sooner exchanged three or four words with his new acquaintance than he began to address him in the second person singular. Yet although he did the same to the Chief of Police and the Public Prosecutor, the company had no sooner seated themselves at the card-table than both the one and the other of these functionaries started to keep a careful eye upon Nozdrev’s tricks, and to watch practically every card which he played. The following evening Chichikov spent with the President of the Local Council, who received his guests—even though the latter included two ladies—in a greasy dressing-gown. Upon that followed an evening at the Vice-Governor’s, a large dinner party at the house of the Commissioner of Taxes, a smaller dinner-party at the house of the Public Prosecutor (a very wealthy man), and a subsequent reception given by the Mayor. In short, not an hour of the day did Chichikov find himself forced to spend at home, and his return to the inn became necessary only for the purposes of sleeping. Somehow or other he had landed on his feet, and everywhere he figured as an experienced man of the world. No matter what the conversation chanced to be about, he always contrived to maintain his part in the same. Did the discourse turn upon horse-breeding, upon horse-breeding he happened to be peculiarly well-qualified to speak. Did the company fall to discussing well-bred dogs, at once he had remarks of the most pertinent kind possible to offer. Did the company touch upon a prosecution which had recently been carried out by the Excise Department, instantly he showed that he too was not wholly unacquainted with legal affairs. Did an opinion chance to be expressed concerning billiards, on that subject too he was at least able to avoid committing a blunder. Did a reference occur to virtue, concerning virtue he hastened to deliver himself in a way which brought tears to every eye. Did the subject in hand happen to be the distilling of brandy—well, that was a matter concerning which he had the soundest of knowledge. Did any one happen to mention Customs officials and inspectors, from that moment he expatiated as though he too had been both a minor functionary and a major. Yet a remarkable fact was the circumstance that he always contrived to temper his omniscience with a certain readiness to give way, a certain ability so to keep a rein upon himself that never did his utterances become too loud or too soft, or transcend what was perfectly befitting. In a word, he was always a gentleman of excellent manners, and every official in the place felt pleased when he saw him enter the door. Thus the Governor gave it as his opinion that Chichikov was a man of excellent intentions; the Public Prosecutor, that he was a good man of business; the Chief of Gendarmery, that he was a man of education; the President of the Local Council, that he was a man of breeding and refinement; and the wife of the Chief of Gendarmery, that his politeness of behaviour was equalled only by his affability of bearing. Nay, even Sobakevitch—who as a rule never spoke well of ANY ONE—said to his lanky wife when, on returning late from the town, he undressed and betook himself to bed by her side: “My dear, this evening, after dining with the Chief of Police, I went on to the Governor’s, and met there, among others, a certain Paul Ivanovitch Chichikov, who is a Collegiate Councillor and a very pleasant fellow.” To this his spouse replied “Hm!” and then dealt him a hearty kick in the ribs.

Such were the flattering opinions earned by the newcomer to the town; and these opinions he retained until the time when a certain speciality of his, a certain scheme of his (the reader will learn presently what it was), plunged the majority of the townsfolk into a sea of perplexity.', 'https://animedia-company.cz/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/cover-mertvye-dushi-600-350x466.jpg', '{comedy,prose}', 22, 'Dead Souls, first published in 1842, is the great prose classic of Russia. That amazing institution, “the Russian novel,” not only began its career with this unfinished masterpiece by Nikolai Vasil’evich Gogol, but practically all the Russian masterpieces that have come since have grown out of it, like the limbs of a single tree. Dostoieffsky goes so far as to bestow this tribute upon an earlier work by the same author, a short story entitled The Cloak; this idea has been wittily expressed by another compatriot, who says: “We have all issued out of Gogol’s Cloak.”

Dead Souls, which bears the word “Poem” upon the title page of the original, has been generally compared to Don Quixote and to the Pickwick Papers, while E. M. Vogue places its author somewhere between Cervantes and Le Sage. However considerable the influences of Cervantes and Dickens may have been—the first in the matter of structure, the other in background, humour, and detail of characterisation—the predominating and distinguishing quality of the work is undeniably something foreign to both and quite peculiar to itself; something which, for want of a better term, might be called the quality of the Russian soul. The English reader familiar with the works of Dostoieffsky, Turgenev, and Tolstoi, need hardly be told what this implies; it might be defined in the words of the French critic just named as “a tendency to pity.” One might indeed go further and say that it implies a certain tolerance of one’s characters even though they be, in the conventional sense, knaves, products, as the case might be, of conditions or circumstance, which after all is the thing to be criticised and not the man. But pity and tolerance are rare in satire, even in clash with it, producing in the result a deep sense of tragic humour. It is this that makes of Dead Souls a unique work, peculiarly Gogolian, peculiarly Russian, and distinct from its author’s Spanish and English masters.

Still more profound are the contradictions to be seen in the author’s personal character; and unfortunately they prevented him from completing his work. The trouble is that he made his art out of life, and when in his final years he carried his struggle, as Tolstoi did later, back into life, he repented of all he had written, and in the frenzy of a wakeful night burned all his manuscripts, including the second part of Dead Souls, only fragments of which were saved. There was yet a third part to be written. Indeed, the second part had been written and burned twice. Accounts differ as to why he had burned it finally. Religious remorse, fury at adverse criticism, and despair at not reaching ideal perfection are among the reasons given. Again it is said that he had destroyed the manuscript with the others inadvertently.');

Chapter 1
A Long-expected Party
When Mr. Bilbo Baggins of Bag End announced that he would shortly be celebrating his eleventy-first birthday with a party of special magnificence, there was much talk and excitement in Hobbiton.

Bilbo was very rich and very peculiar, and had been the wonder of the Shire for sixty years, ever since his remarkable disappearance and unexpected return. The riches he had brought back from his travels had now become a local legend, and it was popularly believed, whatever the old folk might say, that the Hill at Bag End was full of tunnels stuffed with treasure. And if that was not enough for fame, there was also his prolonged vigour to marvel at. Time wore on, but it seemed to have little effect on Mr. Baggins. At ninety he was much the same as at fifty. At ninety-nine they began to call him well-preserved, but unchanged would have been nearer the mark. There were some that shook their heads and thought this was too much of a good thing; it seemed unfair that anyone should possess (apparently) perpetual youth as well as (reputedly) inexhaustible wealth.

‘It will have to be paid for,’ they said. ‘It isn’t natural, and trouble will come of it!’

But so far trouble had not come; and as Mr. Baggins was generous with his money, most people were willing to forgive him his oddities and his good fortune. He remained on visiting terms with his relatives (except, of course, the Sackville-Bagginses), and he had many devoted admirers among the hobbits of poor and unimportant families. But he had no close friends, until some of his younger cousins began to grow up.

The eldest of these, and Bilbo’s favourite, was young Frodo Baggins. When Bilbo was ninety-nine, he adopted Frodo as his heir, and brought him to live at Bag End; and the hopes of the Sackville-Bagginses were finally dashed. Bilbo and Frodo happened to have the same birthday, September 22nd. ‘You had better come and live here, Frodo my lad,’ said Bilbo one day; ‘and then we can celebrate our birthday-parties comfortably together.’ At that time Frodo was still in his tweens, as the hobbits called the irresponsible twenties between childhood and coming of age at thirty-three.

Twelve more years passed. Each year the Bagginses had given very lively combined birthday-parties at Bag End; but now it was understood that something quite exceptional was being planned for that autumn. Bilbo was going to be eleventy-one, 111, a rather curious number and a very respectable age for a hobbit (the Old Took himself had only reached 130); and Frodo was going to be thirty-three, 33) an important number: the date of his ‘coming of age’.

Tongues began to wag in Hobbiton and Bywater; and rumour of the coming event travelled all over the Shire. The history and character of Mr. Bilbo Baggins became once again the chief topic of conversation; and the older folk suddenly found their reminiscences in welcome demand.

No one had a more attentive audience than old Ham Gamgee, commonly known as the Gaffer. He held forth at The Ivy Bush, a small inn on the Bywater road; and he spoke with some authority, for he had tended the garden at Bag End for forty years, and had helped old Holman in the same job before that. Now that he was himself growing old and stiff in the joints, the job was mainly carried on by his youngest son, Sam Gamgee. Both father and son were on very friendly terms with Bilbo and Frodo. They lived on the Hill itself, in Number 3 Bagshot Row just below Bag End.

‘A very nice well-spoken gentlehobbit is Mr. Bilbo, as I’ve always said,’ the Gaffer declared. With perfect truth: for Bilbo was very polite to him, calling him ‘Master Hamfast’, and consulting him constantly upon the growing of vegetables - in the matter of ‘roots’, especially potatoes, the Gaffer was recognized as the leading authority by all in the neighbourhood (including himself).

‘But what about this Frodo that lives with him?’ asked Old Noakes of Bywater. ‘Baggins is his name, but he’s more than half a Brandybuck, they say. It beats me why any Baggins of Hobbiton should go looking for a wife away there in Buckland, where folks are so queer.’

‘And no wonder they’re queer,’ put in Daddy Twofoot (the Gaffer’s next-door neighbour), ‘if they live on the wrong side of the Brandywine River, and right agin the Old Forest. That’s a dark bad place, if half the tales be true.’

‘You’re right, Dad!’ said the Gaffer. ‘Not that the Brandybucks of Buck-land live in the Old Forest; but they’re a queer breed, seemingly. They fool about with boats on that big river - and that isn’t natural. Small wonder that trouble came of it, I say. But be that as it may, Mr. Frodo is as nice a young hobbit as you could wish to meet. Very much like Mr. Bilbo, and in more than looks. After all his father was a Baggins. A decent respectable hobbit was Mr. Drogo Baggins; there was never much to tell of him, till he was drownded.’

‘Drownded?’ said several voices. They had heard this and other darker rumours before, of course; but hobbits have a passion for family history, and they were ready to hear it again. ‘Well, so they say,’ said the Gaffer. ‘You see: Mr. Drogo, he married poor Miss Primula Brandybuck. She was our Mr. Bilbo’s first cousin on the mother’s side (her mother being the youngest of the Old Took’s daughters); and Mr. Drogo was his second cousin. So Mr. Frodo is his first and second cousin, once removed either way, as the saying is, if you follow me. And Mr. Drogo was staying at Brandy Hall with his father-in-law, old Master Gorbadoc, as he often did after his marriage (him being partial to his vittles, and old Gorbadoc keeping a mighty generous table); and he went out boating on the Brandywine River; and he and his wife were drownded, and poor Mr. Frodo only a child and all. ‘

‘I’ve heard they went on the water after dinner in the moonlight,’ said Old Noakes; ‘and it was Drogo’s weight as sunk the boat.’

‘And I heard she pushed him in, and he pulled her in after him,’ said Sandyman, the Hobbiton miller.

‘You shouldn’t listen to all you hear, Sandyman,’ said the Gaffer, who did not much like the miller. ‘There isn’t no call to go talking of pushing and pulling. Boats are quite tricky enough for those that sit still without looking further for the cause of trouble. Anyway: there was this Mr. Frodo left an orphan and stranded, as you might say, among those queer Bucklanders, being brought up anyhow in Brandy Hall. A regular warren, by all accounts. Old Master Gorbadoc never had fewer than a couple of hundred relations in the place. Mr. Bilbo never did a kinder deed than when he brought the lad back to live among decent folk.

‘But I reckon it was a nasty shock for those Sackville-Bagginses. They thought they were going to get Bag End, that time when he went off and was thought to be dead. And then he comes back and orders them off; and he goes on living and living, and never looking a day older, bless him! And suddenly he produces an heir, and has all the papers made out proper. The Sackville-Bagginses won’t never see the inside of Bag End now, or it is to be hoped not.’

‘There’s a tidy bit of money tucked away up there, I hear tell,’ said a stranger, a visitor on business from Michel Delving in the Westfarthing. ‘All the top of your hill is full of tunnels packed with chests of gold and silver, and jools, by what I’ve heard. ‘

‘Then you’ve heard more than I can speak to,’ answered the Gaffer. I know nothing about jools. Mr. Bilbo is free with his money, and there seems no lack of it; but I know of no tunnel-making. I saw Mr. Bilbo when he came back, a matter of sixty years ago, when I was a lad. I’d not long come prentice to old Holman (him being my dad’s cousin), but he had me up at Bag End helping him to keep folks from trampling and trapessing all over the garden while the sale was on. And in the middle of it all Mr. Bilbo comes up the Hill with a pony and some mighty big bags and a couple of chests. I don’t doubt they were mostly full of treasure he had picked up in foreign parts, where there be mountains of gold, they say; but there wasn’t enough to fill tunnels. But my lad Sam will know more about that. He’s in and out of Bag End. Crazy about stories of the old days he is, and he listens to all Mr. Bilbo’s tales. Mr. Bilbo has learned him his letters - meaning no harm, mark you, and I hope no harm will come of it.

‘Elves and Dragons’ I says to him. ‘Cabbages and potatoes are better for me and you. Don’t go getting mixed up in the business of your betters, or you’ll land in trouble too big for you,’ I says to him. And I might say it to others,’ he added with a look at the stranger and the miller.

But the Gaffer did not convince his audience. The legend of Bilbo’s wealth was now too firmly fixed in the minds of the younger generation of hobbits.

‘Ah, but he has likely enough been adding to what he brought at first,’ argued the miller, voicing common opinion. ‘He’s often away from home. And look at the outlandish folk that visit him: dwarves coming at night, and that old wandering conjuror, Gandalf, and all. You can say what you like, Gaffer, but Bag End’s a queer place, and its folk are queerer.’

‘And you can say what you like, about what you know no more of than you do of boating, Mr. Sandyman,’ retorted the Gaffer, disliking the miller even more than usual. If that’s being queer, then we could do with a bit more queerness in these parts. There’s some not far away that wouldn’t offer a pint of beer to a friend, if they lived in a hole with golden walls. But they do things proper at Bag End. Our Sam says that everyone’s going to be invited to the party, and there’s going to be presents, mark you, presents for all - this very month as is.’

That very month was September, and as fine as you could ask. A day or two later a rumour (probably started by the knowledgeable Sam) was spread about that there were going to be fireworks - fireworks, what is more, such as had not been seen in the Shire for nigh on a century, not indeed since the Old Took died.

Days passed and The Day drew nearer. An odd-looking waggon laden with odd-looking packages rolled into Hobbiton one evening and toiled up the Hill to Bag End. The startled hobbits peered out of lamplit doors to gape at it. It was driven by outlandish folk, singing strange songs: dwarves with long beards and deep hoods. A few of them remained at Bag End. At the end of the second week in September a cart came in through Bywater from the direction of the Brandywine Bridge in broad daylight. An old man was driving it all alone. He wore a tall pointed blue hat, a long grey cloak, and a silver scarf. He had a long white beard and bushy eyebrows that stuck out beyond the brim of his hat. Small hobbit-children ran after the cart all through Hobbiton and right up the hill. It had a cargo of fireworks, as they rightly guessed. At Bilbo’s front door the old man began to unload: there were great bundles of fireworks of all sorts and shapes, each labelled with a large red G  and the elf-rune, .

That was Gandalf’s mark, of course, and the old man was Gandalf the Wizard, whose fame in the Shire was due mainly to his skill with fires, smokes, and lights. His real business was far more difficult and dangerous, but the Shire-folk knew nothing about it. To them he was just one of the ‘attractions’ at the Party. Hence the excitement of the hobbit-children. ‘G for Grand!’ they shouted, and the old man smiled. They knew him by sight, though he only appeared in Hobbiton occasionally and never stopped long; but neither they nor any but the oldest of their elders had seen one of his firework displays - they now belonged to the legendary past.

When the old man, helped by Bilbo and some dwarves, had finished unloading. Bilbo gave a few pennies away; but not a single squib or cracker was forthcoming, to the disappointment of the onlookers.

‘Run away now!’ said Gandalf. ‘You will get plenty when the time comes.’ Then he disappeared inside with Bilbo, and the door was shut. The young hobbits stared at the door in vain for a while, and then made off, feeling that the day of the party would never come.

Inside Bag End, Bilbo and Gandalf were sitting at the open window of a small room looking out west on to the garden. The late afternoon was bright and peaceful. The flowers glowed red and golden: snap-dragons and sun-flowers, and nasturtiums trailing all over the turf walls and peeping in at the round windows.

‘How bright your garden looks!’ said Gandalf.

‘Yes,’ said Bilbo. I am very fond indeed of it, and of all the dear old Shire; but I think I need a holiday.’

‘You mean to go on with your plan then?’

‘I do. I made up my mind months ago, and I haven’t changed it.’

‘Very well. It is no good saying any more. Stick to your plan - your whole plan, mind - and I hope it will turn out for the best, for you, and for all of us.’

‘I hope so. Anyway I mean to enjoy myself on Thursday, and have my little joke.’

‘Who will laugh, I wonder?’ said Gandalf, shaking his head.

‘We shall see,’ said Bilbo.

The next day more carts rolled up the Hill, and still more carts. There might have been some grumbling about ‘dealing locally’, but that very week orders began to pour out of Bag End for every kind of provision, commodity, or luxury that could be obtained in Hobbiton or Bywater or anywhere in the neighbourhood. People became enthusiastic; and they began to tick off the days on the calendar; and they watched eagerly for the postman, hoping for invitations.

Before long the invitations began pouring out, and the Hobbiton post-office was blocked, and the Bywater post-office was snowed under, and voluntary assistant postmen were called for. There was a constant stream of them going up the Hill, carrying hundreds of polite variations on Thank you, I shall certainly come.

A notice appeared on the gate at Bag End: no admittance except on party business. Even those who had, or pretended to have Party Business were seldom allowed inside. Bilbo was busy: writing invitations, ticking off answers, packing up presents, and making some private preparations of his own. From the time of Gandalf’s arrival he remained hidden from view.

One morning the hobbits woke to find the large field, south of Bilbo’s front door, covered with ropes and poles for tents and pavilions. A special entrance was cut into the bank leading to the road, and wide steps and a large white gate were built there. The three hobbit-families of Bagshot Row, adjoining the field, were intensely interested and generally envied. Old Gaffer Gamgee stopped even pretending to work in his garden.

The tents began to go up. There was a specially large pavilion, so big that the tree that grew in the field was right inside it, and stood proudly near one end, at the head of the chief table. Lanterns were hung on all its branches. More promising still (to the hobbits’ mind): an enormous open-air kitchen was erected in the north corner of the field. A draught of cooks, from every inn and eating-house for miles around, arrived to supplement the dwarves and other odd folk that were quartered at Bag End. Excitement rose to its height.

Then the weather clouded over. That was on Wednesday the eve of the Party. Anxiety was intense. Then Thursday, September the 22nd, actually dawned. The sun got up, the clouds vanished, flags were unfurled and the fun began.

Bilbo Baggins called it a party, but it was really a variety of entertainments rolled into one. Practically everybody living near was invited. A very few were overlooked by accident, but as they turned up all the same, that did not matter. Many people from other parts of the Shire were also asked; and there were even a few from outside the borders. Bilbo met the guests (and additions) at the new white gate in person. He gave away presents to all and sundry - the latter were those who went out again by a back way and came in again by the gate. Hobbits give presents to other people on their own birthdays. Not very expensive ones, as a rule, and not so lavishly as on this occasion; but it was not a bad system. Actually in Hobbiton and Bywater every day in the year it was somebody’s birthday, so that every hobbit in those parts had a fair chance of at least one present at least once a week. But they never got tired of them.

On this occasion the presents were unusually good. The hobbit-children were so excited that for a while they almost forgot about eating. There were toys the like of which they had never seen before, all beautiful and some obviously magical. Many of them had indeed been ordered a year before, and had come all the way from the Mountain and from Dale, and were of real dwarf-make.

When every guest had been welcomed and was finally inside the gate, there were songs, dances, music, games, and, of course, food and drink. There were three official meals: lunch, tea, and dinner (or supper). But lunch and tea were marked chiefly by the fact that at those times all the guests were sitting down and eating together. At other times there were merely lots of people eating and drinking - continuously from elevenses until six-thirty, when the fireworks started.

The fireworks were by Gandalf: they were not only brought by him, but designed and made by him; and the special effects, set pieces, and flights of rockets were let off by him. But there was also a generous distribution of squibs, crackers, backarappers, sparklers, torches, dwarf-candles, elf-fountains, goblin-barkers and thunder-claps. They were all superb. The art of Gandalf improved with age.

There were rockets like a flight of scintillating birds singing with sweet voices. There were green trees with trunks of dark smoke: their leaves opened like a whole spring unfolding in a moment, and their shining branches dropped glowing flowers down upon the astonished hobbits, disappearing with a sweet scent just before they touched their upturned faces. There were fountains of butterflies that flew glittering into the trees; there were pillars of coloured fires that rose and turned into eagles, or sailing ships, or a phalanx of flying swans; there was a red thunderstorm and a shower of yellow rain; there was a forest of silver spears that sprang suddenly into the air with a yell like an embattled army, and came down again into the Water with a hiss like a hundred hot snakes. And there was also one last surprise, in honour of Bilbo, and it startled the hobbits exceedingly, as Gandalf intended. The lights went out. A great smoke went up. It shaped itself like a mountain seen in the distance, and began to glow at the summit. It spouted green and scarlet flames. Out flew a red-golden dragon - not life-size, but terribly life-like: fire came from his jaws, his eyes glared down; there was a roar, and he whizzed three times over the heads of the crowd. They all ducked, and many fell flat on their faces. The dragon passed like an express train, turned a somersault, and burst over Bywater with a deafening explosion.

‘That is the signal for supper!’ said Bilbo. The pain and alarm vanished at once, and the prostrate hobbits leaped to their feet. There was a splendid supper for everyone; for everyone, that is, except those invited to the special family dinner-party. This was held in the great pavilion with the tree. The invitations were limited to twelve dozen (a number also called by the hobbits one Gross, though the word was not considered proper to use of people); and the guests were selected from all the families to which Bilbo and Frodo were related, with the addition of a few special unrelated friends (such as Gandalf). Many young hobbits were included, and present by parental permission; for hobbits were easy-going with their children in the matter of sitting up late, especially when there was a chance of getting them a free meal. Bringing up young hobbits took a lot of provender.

There were many Bagginses and Boffins, and also many Tooks and Brandybucks; there were various Grubbs (relations of Bilbo Baggins’ grandmother), and various Chubbs (connexions of his Took grandfather); and a selection of Burrowses, Bolgers, Bracegirdles, Brockhouses, Goodbodies, Hornblowers and Proudfoots. Some of these were only very distantly connected with Bilbo, and some of them had hardly ever been in Hobbiton before, as they lived in remote corners of the Shire. The Sackville-Bagginses were not forgotten. Otho and his wife Lobelia were present. They disliked Bilbo and detested Frodo, but so magnificent was the invitation card, written in golden ink, that they had felt it was impossible to refuse. Besides, their cousin, Bilbo, had been specializing in food for many years and his table had a high reputation.

All the one hundred and forty-four guests expected a pleasant feast; though they rather dreaded the after-dinner speech of their host (an inevitable item). He was liable to drag in bits of what he called poetry; and sometimes, after a glass or two, would allude to the absurd adventures of his mysterious journey. The guests were not disappointed: they had a very pleasant feast, in fact an engrossing entertainment: rich, abundant, varied, and prolonged. The purchase of provisions fell almost to nothing throughout the district in the ensuing weeks; but as Bilbo’s catering had depleted the stocks of most stores, cellars and warehouses for miles around, that did not matter much.

After the feast (more or less) came the Speech. Most of the company were, however, now in a tolerant mood, at that delightful stage which they called ‘filling up the corners’. They were sipping their favourite drinks, and nibbling at their favourite dainties, and their fears were forgotten. They were prepared to listen to anything, and to cheer at every full stop.

My dear People, began Bilbo, rising in his place. ‘Hear! Hear! Hear!’ they shouted, and kept on repeating it in chorus, seeming reluctant to follow their own advice. Bilbo left his place and went and stood on a chair under the illuminated tree. The light of the lanterns fell on his beaming face; the golden buttons shone on his embroidered silk waistcoat. They could all see him standing, waving one hand in the air, the other was in his trouser-pocket.

My dear Bagginses and Boffins, he began again; and my dear Tooks and Brandybucks, and Grubbs, and Chubbs, and Burrowses, and Hornblowers, and Bolgers, Bracegirdles, Goodbodies, Brockhouses and Proudfoots. ‘ProudFEET!’ shouted an elderly hobbit from the back of the pavilion. His name, of course, was Proudfoot, and well merited; his feet were large, exceptionally furry, and both were on the table.

Proudfoots, repeated Bilbo. Also my good Sackville-Bagginses that I welcome back at last to Bag End. Today is my one hundred and eleventh birthday: I am eleventy-one today! ‘Hurray! Hurray! Many Happy Returns!’ they shouted, and they hammered joyously on the tables. Bilbo was doing splendidly. This was the sort of stuff they liked: short and obvious.

/ hope you are all enjoying yourselves as much as I am. Deafening cheers. Cries of Yes (and No). Noises of trumpets and horns, pipes and flutes, and other musical instruments. There were, as has been said, many young hobbits present. Hundreds of musical crackers had been pulled. Most of them bore the mark dale on them; which did not convey much to most of the hobbits, but they all agreed they were marvellous crackers. They contained instruments, small, but of perfect make and enchanting tones. Indeed, in one corner some of the young Tooks and Brandybucks, supposing Uncle Bilbo to have finished (since he had plainly said all that was necessary), now got up an impromptu orchestra, and began a merry dance-tune. Master Everard Took and Miss Melilot Brandybuck got on a table and with bells in their hands began to dance the Springle-ring: a pretty dance, but rather vigorous.

But Bilbo had not finished. Seizing a horn from a youngster near by, he blew three loud hoots. The noise subsided. / shall not keep you long, he cried. Cheers from all the assembly. / have called you all together for a Purpose. Something in the way that he said this made an impression. There was almost silence, and one or two of the Tooks pricked up their ears.

Indeed, for Three Purposes! First of all, to tell you that I am immensely fond of you all, and that eleventy-one years is too short a time to live among such excellent and admirable hobbits. Tremendous outburst of approval.

/ don’t know half of you half as well as I should like; and I like less than half of you half as well as you deserve. This was unexpected and rather difficult. There was some scattered clapping, but most of them were trying to work it out and see if it came to a compliment.

Secondly, to celebrate my birthday. Cheers again. / should say: OUR birthday. For it is, of course, also the birthday of my heir and nephew, Frodo. He comes of age and into his inheritance today. Some perfunctory clapping by the elders; and some loud shouts of ‘Frodo! Frodo! Jolly old Frodo,’ from the juniors. The Sackville-Bagginses scowled, and wondered what was meant by ‘coming into his inheritance’. Together we score one hundred and forty-four. Your numbers were chosen to fit this remarkable total: One Gross, if I may use the expression. No cheers. This was ridiculous. Many of his guests, and especially the Sackville-Bagginses, were insulted, feeling sure they had only been asked to fill up the required number, like goods in a package. ‘One Gross, indeed! Vulgar expression.’

It is also, if I may be allowed to refer to ancient history, the anniversary of my arrival by barrel at Esgaroth on the Long Lake; though the fact that it was my birthday slipped my memory on that occasion. I was only fifty-one then, and birthdays did not seem so important. The banquet was very splendid, however, though I had a bad cold at the time, I remember, and could only say ‘thag you very buch’. I now repeat it more correctly: Thank you very much for coming to my little party. Obstinate silence. They all feared that a song or some poetry was now imminent; and they were getting bored. Why couldn’t he stop talking and let them drink his health? But Bilbo did not sing or recite. He paused for a moment.

Thirdly and finally, he said, I wish to make an ANNOUNCEMENT. He spoke this last word so loudly and suddenly that everyone sat up who still could. I regret to announce that - though, as I said, eleventy-one years is far too short a time to spend among you - this is the END. I am going. I am leaving NOW. GOOD-BYE!

He stepped down and vanished. There was a blinding flash of light, and the guests all blinked. When they opened their eyes Bilbo was nowhere to be seen. One hundred and forty-four flabbergasted hobbits sat back speechless. Old Odo Proudfoot removed his feet from the table and stamped. Then there was a dead silence, until suddenly, after several deep breaths, every Baggins, Boffin, Took, Brandybuck, Grubb, Chubb, Burrows, Bolger, Bracegirdle, Brockhouse, Goodbody, Hornblower, and Proudfoot began to talk at once.

It was generally agreed that the joke was in very bad taste, and more food and drink were needed to cure the guests of shock and annoyance. ‘He’s mad. I always said so,’ was probably the most popular comment. Even the Tooks (with a few exceptions) thought Bilbo’s behaviour was absurd. For the moment most of them took it for granted that his disappearance was nothing more than a ridiculous prank.

But old Rory Brandybuck was not so sure. Neither age nor an enormous dinner had clouded his wits, and he said to his daughter-in-law, Esmeralda: ‘There’s something fishy in this, my dear! I believe that mad Baggins is off again. Silly old fool. But why worry? He hasn’t taken the vittles with him.’ He called loudly to Frodo to send the wine round again.

Frodo was the only one present who had said nothing. For some time he had sat silent beside Bilbo’s empty chair, and ignored all remarks and questions. He had enjoyed the joke, of course, even though he had been in the know. He had difficulty in keeping from laughter at the indignant surprise of the guests. But at the same time he felt deeply troubled: he realized suddenly that he loved the old hobbit dearly. Most of the guests went on eating and drinking and discussing Bilbo Baggins’ oddities, past and present; but the Sackville-Bagginses had already departed in wrath. Frodo did not want to have any more to do with the party. He gave orders for more wine to be served; then he got up and drained his own glass silently to the health of Bilbo, and slipped out of the pavilion.

As for Bilbo Baggins, even while he was making his speech, he had been fingering the golden ring in his pocket: his magic ring that he had kept secret for so many years. As he stepped down he slipped it on his finger, and he was never seen by any hobbit in Hobbiton again.

He walked briskly back to his hole, and stood for a moment listening with a smile to the din in the pavilion and to the sounds of merrymaking in other parts of the field. Then he went in. He took off his party clothes, folded up and wrapped in tissue-paper his embroidered silk waistcoat, and put it away. Then he put on quickly some old untidy garments, and fastened round his waist a worn leather belt. On it he hung a short sword in a battered black-leather scabbard. From a locked drawer, smelling of moth-balls, he took out an old cloak and hood. They had been locked up as if they were very precious, but they were so patched and weatherstained that their original colour could hardly be guessed: it might have been dark green. They were rather too large for him. He then went into his study, and from a large strong-box took out a bundle wrapped in old cloths, and a leather-bound manuscript; and also a large bulky envelope. The book and bundle he stuffed into the top of a heavy bag that was standing there, already nearly full. Into the envelope he slipped his golden ring, and its fine chain, and then sealed it, and addressed it to Frodo. At first he put it on the mantelpiece, but suddenly he removed it and stuck it in his pocket. At that moment the door opened and Gandalf came quickly in.

‘Hullo!’ said Bilbo. ''I wondered if you would turn up.’

''I am glad to find you visible,’ replied the wizard, sitting down in a chair, ''I wanted to catch you and have a few final words. I suppose you feel that everything has gone off splendidly and according to plan?’

‘Yes, I do,’ said Bilbo. "Though that flash was surprising: it quite startled me, let alone the others. A little addition of your own, I suppose?’

It was. You have wisely kept that ring secret all these years, and it seemed to me necessary to give your guests something else that would seem to explain your sudden vanishment.’

‘And would spoil my joke. You are an interfering old busybody,’ laughed Bilbo, ‘but I expect you know best, as usual.’

‘I do - when I know anything. But I don’t feel too sure about this whole affair. It has now come to the final point. You have had your joke, and alarmed or offended most of your relations, and given the whole Shire something to talk about for nine days, or ninety-nine more likely. Are you going any further?’

‘Yes, I am. I feel I need a holiday, a very long holiday, as I have told you before. Probably a permanent holiday: I don’t expect I shall return. In fact, I don’t mean to, and I have made all arrangements.

''I am old, Gandalf. I don’t look it, but I am beginning to feel it in my heart of hearts. Well-preserved indeed!’ he snorted. ‘Why, I feel all thin, sort of stretched, if you know what I mean: like butter that has been scraped over too much bread. That can’t be right. I need a change, or something.’

Gandalf looked curiously and closely at him. ‘No, it does not seem right,’ he said thoughtfully. ‘No, after all I believe your plan is probably the best.’

‘Well, I’ve made up my mind, anyway. I want to see mountains again, Gandalf, mountains, and then find somewhere where I can rest. In peace and quiet, without a lot of relatives prying around, and a string of confounded visitors hanging on the bell. I might find somewhere where I can finish my book. I have thought of a nice ending for it: and he lived happily ever after to the end of his days. ‘

Gandalf laughed. I hope he will. But nobody will read the book, however it ends.’

‘Oh, they may, in years to come. Frodo has read some already, as far as it has gone. You’ll keep an eye on Frodo, won’t you?’

‘Yes, I will - two eyes, as often as I can spare them.’

‘He would come with me, of course, if I asked him. In fact he offered to once, just before the party. But he does not really want to, yet. I want to see the wild country again before I die, and the Mountains; but he is still in love with the Shire, with woods and fields and little rivers. He ought to be comfortable here. I am leaving everything to him, of course, except a few oddments. I hope he will be happy, when he gets used to being on his own. It’s time he was his own master now.’

‘Everything?’ said Gandalf. ‘The ring as well? You agreed to that, you remember.’

‘Well, er, yes, I suppose so,’ stammered Bilbo.

‘Where is it?’

‘In an envelope, if you must know,’ said Bilbo impatiently. ‘There on the mantelpiece. Well, no! Here it is in my pocket!’ He hesitated. ‘Isn’t that odd now?’ he said softly to himself. ‘Yet after all, why not? Why shouldn’t it stay there?’

Gandalf looked again very hard at Bilbo, and there was a gleam in his eyes. ‘I think, Bilbo,’ he said quietly, ‘I should leave it behind. Don’t you want to?’

‘Well yes - and no. Now it comes to it, I don’t like parting with it at all, I may say. And I don’t really see why I should. Why do you want me to?’ he asked, and a curious change came over his voice. It was sharp with suspicion and annoyance. ‘You are always badgering me about my ring; but you have never bothered me about the other things that I got on my journey.’

‘No, but I had to badger you,’ said Gandalf. ‘I wanted the truth. It was important. Magic rings are - well, magical; and they are rare and curious. I was professionally interested in your ring, you may say; and I still am. I should like to know where it is, if you go wandering again. Also I think you have had it quite long enough. You won’t need it any more. Bilbo, unless I am quite mistaken.’

Bilbo flushed, and there was an angry light in his eyes. His kindly face grew hard. ‘Why not?’ he cried. ‘And what business is it of yours, anyway, to know what I do with my own things? It is my own. I found it. It came to me.’

‘Yes, yes,’ said Gandalf. ‘But there is no need to get angry.’

‘If I am it is your fault,’ said Bilbo. ‘It is mine, I tell you. My own. My precious. Yes, my precious.’

The wizard’s face remained grave and attentive, and only a flicker in his deep eyes showed that he was startled and indeed alarmed. ‘It has been called that before,’ he said, ‘but not by you.’

‘But I say it now. And why not? Even if Gollum said the same once. It’s not his now, but mine. And I shall keep it, I say.’

Gandalf stood up. He spoke sternly. ‘You will be a fool if you do. Bilbo,’ he said. ‘You make that clearer with every word you say. It has got far too much hold on you. Let it go! And then you can go yourself, and be free.’

‘I’ll do as I choose and go as I please,’ said Bilbo obstinately.

‘Now, now, my dear hobbit! ‘ said Gandalf. ‘All your long life we have been friends, and you owe me something. Come! Do as you promised: give it up! ‘

‘Well, if you want my ring yourself, say so!’ cried Bilbo. ‘But you won’t get it. I won’t give my precious away, I tell you.’ His hand strayed to the hilt of his small sword.

Gandalf’s eyes flashed. It will be my turn to get angry soon,’ he said. If you say that again, I shall. Then you will see Gandalf the Grey uncloaked.’ He took a step towards the hobbit, and he seemed to grow tall and menacing; his shadow filled the little room.

Bilbo backed away to the wall, breathing hard, his hand clutching at his pocket. They stood for a while facing one another, and the air of the room tingled. Gandalf’s eyes remained bent on the hobbit. Slowly his hands relaxed, and he began to tremble.

‘I don’t know what has come over you, Gandalf,’ he said. ‘You have never been like this before. What is it all about? It is mine isn’t it? I found it, and Gollum would have killed me, if I hadn’t kept it. I’m not a thief, whatever he said.’

‘I have never called you one,’ Gandalf answered. ‘And I am not one either. I am not trying to rob you, but to help you. I wish you would trust me, as you used.’ He turned away, and the shadow passed. He seemed to dwindle again to an old grey man, bent and troubled.

Bilbo drew his hand over his eyes. I am sorry,’ he said. ‘But I felt so queer. And yet it would be a relief in a way not to be bothered with it any more. It has been so growing on my mind lately. Sometimes I have felt it was like an eye looking at me. And I am always wanting to put it on and disappear, don’t you know; or wondering if it is safe, and pulling it out to make sure. I tried locking it up, but I found I couldn’t rest without it in my pocket. I don’t know why. And I don’t seem able to make up my mind.’

‘Then trust mine,’ said Gandalf. ‘It is quite made up. Go away and leave it behind. Stop possessing it. Give it to Frodo, and I will look after him.’

Bilbo stood for a moment tense and undecided. Presently he sighed. ‘All right,’ he said with an effort. I will.’ Then he shrugged his shoulders, and smiled rather ruefully. ‘After all that’s what this party business was all about, really: to give away lots of birthday presents, and somehow make it easier to give it away at the same time. It hasn’t made it any easier in the end, but it would be a pity to waste all my preparations. It would quite spoil the joke.’

‘Indeed it would take away the only point I ever saw in the affair,’ said Gandalf.

‘Very well,’ said Bilbo, ‘it goes to Frodo with all the rest.’ He drew a deep breath. ‘And now I really must be starting, or somebody else will catch me. I have said good-bye, and I couldn’t bear to do it all over again.’ He picked up his bag and moved to the door.

‘You have still got the ring in your pocket,’ said the wizard. ‘Well, so I have!’ cried Bilbo. ‘And my will and all the other documents too. You had better take it and deliver it for me. That will be safest.’

‘No, don’t give the ring to me,’ said Gandalf. ‘Put it on the mantelpiece. It will be safe enough there, till Frodo comes. I shall wait for him.’

Bilbo took out the envelope, but just as he was about to set it by the clock, his hand jerked back, and the packet fell on the floor. Before he could pick it up, the wizard stooped and seized it and set it in its place. A spasm of anger passed swiftly over the hobbit’s face again. Suddenly it gave way to a look of relief and a laugh. ‘Well, that’s that,’ he said. ‘Now I’m off!’

They went out into the hall. Bilbo chose his favourite stick from the stand; then he whistled. Three dwarves came out of different rooms where they had been busy.

‘Is everything ready?’ asked Bilbo. ‘Everything packed and labelled?’

‘Everything,’ they answered.

‘Well, let’s start then!’ He stepped out of the front-door.

It was a fine night, and the black sky was dotted with stars. He looked up, sniffing the air. ‘What fun! What fun to be off again, off on the Road with dwarves! This is what I have really been longing for, for years! Good-bye! ‘ he said, looking at his old home and bowing to the door. ‘Good-bye, Gandalf!’

‘Good-bye, for the present, Bilbo. Take care of yourself! You are old enough, and perhaps wise enough.’

‘Take care! I don’t care. Don’t you worry about me! I am as happy now as I have ever been, and that is saying a great deal. But the time has come. I am being swept off my feet at last,’ he added, and then in a low voice, as if to himself, he sang softly in the dark:

The Road goes ever on and on

Down from the door where it began.

Now far ahead the Road has gone,

And I must follow, if I can,

Pursuing it with eager feet,

Until it joins some larger way

Where many paths and errands meet.

And whither then? I cannot say.

He paused, silent for a moment. Then without another word he turned away from the lights and voices in the fields and tents, and followed by his three companions went round into his garden, and trotted down the long sloping path. He jumped over a low place in the hedge at the bottom, and took to the meadows, passing into the night like a rustle of wind in the grass.

Gandalf remained for a while staring after him into the darkness. ‘Goodbye, my dear Bilbo - until our next meeting!’ he said softly and went back indoors.

Frodo came in soon afterwards, and found him sitting in the dark, deep in thought. ‘Has he gone?’ he asked.

‘Yes,’ answered Gandalf, ‘he has gone at last.’

'' I wish - I mean, I hoped until this evening that it was only a joke,’ said Frodo. ‘But I knew in my heart that he really meant to go. He always used to joke about serious things. I wish I had come back sooner, just to see him off.’

I think really he preferred slipping off quietly in the end,’ said Gandalf. ‘Don’t be too troubled. He’ll be all right - now. He left a packet for you. There it is!’

Frodo took the envelope from the mantelpiece, and glanced at it, but did not open it.

‘You’ll find his will and all the other documents in there, I think,’ said the wizard. ‘You are the master of Bag End now. And also, I fancy, you’ll find a golden ring.’

‘The ring!’ exclaimed Frodo. ‘Has he left me that? I wonder why. Still, it may be useful.’

‘It may, and it may not,’ said Gandalf. ‘I should not make use of it, if I were you. But keep it secret, and keep it safe! Now I am going to bed.’

As master of Bag End Frodo felt it his painful duty to say good-bye to the guests. Rumours of strange events had by now spread all over the field, but Frodo would only say no doubt everything will be cleared up in the morning. About midnight carriages came for the important folk. One by one they rolled away, filled with full but very unsatisfied hobbits. Gardeners came by arrangement, and removed in wheel-barrows those that had inadvertently remained behind.

Night slowly passed. The sun rose. The hobbits rose rather later. Morning went on. People came and began (by orders) to clear away the pavilions and the tables and the chairs, and the spoons and knives and bottles and plates, and the lanterns, and the flowering shrubs in boxes, and the crumbs and cracker-paper, the forgotten bags and gloves and handkerchiefs, and the uneaten food (a very small item). Then a number of other people came (without orders): Bagginses, and Boffins, and Bolgers, and Tooks, and other guests that lived or were staying near. By mid-day, when even the best-fed were out and about again, there was a large crowd at Bag End, uninvited but not unexpected.

Frodo was waiting on the step, smiling, but looking rather tired and worried. He welcomed all the callers, but he had not much more to say than before. His reply to all inquiries was simply this: ‘Mr. Bilbo Baggins has gone away; as far as I know, for good.’ Some of the visitors he invited to come inside, as Bilbo had left ‘messages’ for them.

Inside in the hall there was piled a large assortment of packages and parcels and small articles of furniture. On every item there was a label tied. There were several labels of this sort:

For ADELARD TOOK, for his VERY OWN, from Bilbo, on an umbrella. Adelard had carried off many unlabelled ones.

For DORA BAGGINS in memory of a LONG correspondence, with love from Bilbo, on a large waste-paper basket. Dora was Drogo’s sister and the eldest surviving female relative of Bilbo and Frodo; she was ninety-nine, and had written reams of good advice for more than half a century.

For MILO BURROWS, hoping it will be useful, from B.B., on a gold pen and ink-bottle. Milo never answered letters.

For ANGELICA’S use, from Uncle Bilbo, on a round convex mirror. She was a young Baggins, and too obviously considered her face shapely.

For the collection of HUGO BRACEGIRDLE, from a contributor, on an (empty) book-case. Hugo was a great borrower of books, and worse than usual at returning them.

For LOBELIA SACKVILLE-BAGGINS, as a PRESENT, on a case of silver spoons. Bilbo believed that she had acquired a good many of his spoons, while he was away on his former journey. Lobelia knew that quite well. When she arrived later in the day, she took the point at once, but she also took the spoons.

This is only a small selection of the assembled presents. Bilbo’s residence had got rather cluttered up with things in the course of his long life. It was a tendency of hobbit-holes to get cluttered up: for which the custom of giving so many birthday-presents was largely responsible. Not, of course, that the birthday-presents were always new, there were one or two old mathoms of forgotten uses that had circulated all around the district; but Bilbo had usually given new presents, and kept those that he received. The old hole was now being cleared a little.

Every one of the various parting gifts had labels, written out personally by Bilbo, and several had some point, or some joke. But, of course, most of the things were given where they would be wanted and welcome. The poorer hobbits, and especially those of Bagshot Row, did very well. Old Gaffer Gamgee got two sacks of potatoes, a new spade, a woollen waistcoat, and a bottle of ointment for creaking joints. Old Rory Brandybuck, in return for much hospitality, got a dozen bottles of Old Winyards: a strong red wine from the Southfarthing, and now quite mature, as it had been laid down by Bilbo’s father. Rory quite forgave Bilbo, and voted him a capital fellow after the first bottle.

There was plenty of everything left for Frodo. And, of course, all the chief treasures, as well as the books, pictures, and more than enough furniture, were left in his possession. There was, however, no sign nor mention of money or jewellery: not a penny-piece or a glass bead was given away.

Frodo had a very trying time that afternoon. A false rumour that the whole household was being distributed free spread like wildfire; and before long the place was packed with people who had no business there, but could not be kept out. Labels got torn off and mixed, and quarrels broke out. Some people tried to do swaps and deals in the hall; and others tried to make off with minor items not addressed to them, or with anything that seemed unwanted or unwatched. The road to the gate was blocked with barrows and handcarts.

In the middle of the commotion the Sackville-Bagginses arrived. Frodo had retired for a while and left his friend Merry Brandybuck to keep an eye on things. When Otho loudly demanded to see Frodo, Merry bowed politely.

‘He is indisposed,’ he said. ‘He is resting.’

‘Hiding, you mean,’ said Lobelia. ‘Anyway we want to see him and we mean to see him. Just go and tell him so!’

Merry left them a long while in the hall, and they had time to discover their parting gift of spoons. It did not improve their tempers. Eventually they were shown into the study. Frodo was sitting at a table with a lot of papers in front of him. He looked indisposed - to see Sackville-Bagginses at any rate; and he stood up, fidgeting with something in his pocket. But he spoke quite politely.

The Sackville-Bagginses were rather offensive. They began by offering him bad bargain-prices (as between friends) for various valuable and unlabelled things. When Frodo replied that only the things specially directed by Bilbo were being given away, they said the whole affair was very fishy.

‘Only one thing is clear to me,’ said Otho, ‘and that is that you are doing exceedingly well out of it. I insist on seeing the will.’

Otho would have been Bilbo’s heir, but for the adoption of Frodo. He read the will carefully and snorted. It was, unfortunately, very clear and correct (according to the legal customs of hobbits, which demand among other things seven signatures of witnesses in red ink).

‘Foiled again!’ he said to his wife. ‘And after waiting sixty years. Spoons? Fiddlesticks!’ He snapped his fingers under Frodo’s nose and slumped off. But Lobelia was not so easily got rid of. A little later Frodo came out of the study to see how things were going on and found her still about the place, investigating nooks and comers and tapping the floors. He escorted her firmly off the premises, after he had relieved her of several small (but rather valuable) articles that had somehow fallen inside her umbrella. Her face looked as if she was in the throes of thinking out a really crushing parting remark; but all she found to say, turning round on the step, was:

‘You’ll live to regret it, young fellow! Why didn’t you go too? You don’t belong here; you’re no Baggins - you - you’re a Brandybuck!’

‘Did you hear that, Merry? That was an insult, if you like,’ said Frodo as he shut the door on her.

‘It was a compliment,’ said Merry Brandybuck, ‘and so, of course, not true.’

Then they went round the hole, and evicted three young hobbits (two Boffins and a Bolger) who were knocking holes in the walls of one of the cellars. Frodo also had a tussle with young Sancho Proudfoot (old Odo Proudfoot’s grandson), who had begun an excavation in the larger pantry, where he thought there was an echo. The legend of Bilbo’s gold excited both curiosity and hope; for legendary gold (mysteriously obtained, if not positively ill-gotten), is, as every one knows, any one’s for the finding - unless the search is interrupted.

When he had overcome Sancho and pushed him out, Frodo collapsed on a chair in the hall. It’s time to close the shop, Merry,’ he said. ‘Lock the door, and don’t open it to anyone today, not even if they bring a battering ram.’ Then he went to revive himself with a belated cup of tea.

He had hardly sat down, when there came a soft knock at the front-door. ‘Lobelia again most likely,’ he thought. ‘She must have thought of something really nasty, and have come back again to say it. It can wait.’

He went on with his tea. The knock was repeated, much louder, but he took no notice. Suddenly the wizard’s head appeared at the window.

‘If you don’t let me in, Frodo, I shall blow your door right down your hole and out through the hill,’ he said.

‘My dear Gandalf! Half a minute!’ cried Frodo, running out of the room to the door. ‘Come in! Come in! I thought it was Lobelia.’

‘Then I forgive you. But I saw her some time ago, driving a pony-trap towards Bywater with a face that would have curdled new milk.’

‘She had already nearly curdled me. Honestly, I nearly tried on Bilbo’s ring. I longed to disappear.’

‘Don’t do that!’ said Gandalf, sitting down. ‘Do be careful of that ring, Frodo! In fact, it is partly about that that I have come to say a last word.’

‘Well, what about it?’

‘What do you know already?’

‘Only what Bilbo told me. I have heard his story: how he found it, and how he used it: on his journey, I mean.’

‘Which story, I wonder,’ said Gandalf.

‘Oh, not what he told the dwarves and put in his book,’ said Frodo. ‘He told me the true story soon after I came to live here. He said you had pestered him till he told you, so I had better know too. "No secrets between us, Frodo," he said; "but they are not to go any further. It’s mine anyway."‘

‘That’s interesting,’ said Gandalf. ‘Well, what did you think of it all?’

‘If you mean, inventing all that about a "present", well, I thought the true story much more likely, and I couldn’t see the point of altering it at all. It was very unlike Bilbo to do so, anyway; and I thought it rather odd.’

‘So did I. But odd things may happen to people that have such treasures - if they use them. Let it be a warning to you to be very careful with it. It may have other powers than just making you vanish when you wish to.’

‘I don’t understand,’ said Frodo.

‘Neither do I,’ answered the wizard. ‘I have merely begun to wonder about the ring, especially since last night. No need to worry. But if you take my advice you will use it very seldom, or not at all. At least I beg you not to use it in any way that will cause talk or rouse suspicion. I say again: keep it safe, and keep it secret!’

‘You are very mysterious! What are you afraid of?’

‘I am not certain, so I will say no more. I may be able to tell you something when I come back. I am going off at once: so this is good-bye for the present.’ He got up.

‘At once!’ cried Frodo. ‘Why, I thought you were staying on for at least a week. I was looking forward to your help.’

‘I did mean to - but I have had to change my mind. I may be away for a good while; but I’ll come and see you again, as soon as I can. Expect me when you see me! I shall slip in quietly. I shan’t often be visiting the Shire openly again. I find that I have become rather unpopular. They say I am a nuisance and a disturber of the peace. Some people are actually accusing me of spiriting Bilbo away, or worse. If you want to know, there is supposed to be a plot between you and me to get hold of his wealth.’

‘Some people!’ exclaimed Frodo. ‘You mean Otho and Lobelia. How abominable! I would give them Bag End and everything else, if I could get Bilbo back and go off tramping in the country with him. I love the Shire. But I begin to wish, somehow, that I had gone too. I wonder if I shall ever see him again.’

‘So do I,’ said Gandalf. ‘And I wonder many other things. Good-bye now! Take care of yourself! Look out for me, especially at unlikely times! Good-bye!’

Frodo saw him to the door. He gave a final wave of his hand, and walked off at a surprising pace; but Frodo thought the old wizard looked unusually bent, almost as if he was carrying a great weight. The evening was closing in, and his cloaked figure quickly vanished into the twilight. Frodo did not see him again for a long time.

 

Chapter 2
The Shadow of the Past
The talk did not die down in nine or even ninety-nine days. The second disappearance of Mr. Bilbo Baggins was discussed in Hobbiton, and indeed all over the Shire, for a year and a day, and was remembered much longer than that. It became a fireside-story for young hobbits; and eventually Mad Baggins, who used to vanish with a bang and a flash and reappear with bags of jewels and gold, became a favourite character of legend and lived on long after all the true events were forgotten.

But in the meantime, the general opinion in the neighbourhood was that Bilbo, who had always been rather cracked, had at last gone quite mad, and had run off into the Blue. There he had undoubtedly fallen into a pool or a river and come to a tragic, but hardly an untimely, end. The blame was mostly laid on Gandalf.

‘If only that dratted wizard will leave young Frodo alone, perhaps he’ll settle down and grow some hobbit-sense,’ they said. And to all appearance the wizard did leave Frodo alone, and he did settle down, but the growth of hobbit-sense was not very noticeable. Indeed, he at once began to carry on Bilbo’s reputation for oddity. He refused to go into mourning; and the next year he gave a party in honour of Bilbo’s hundred-and-twelfth birthday, which he called Hundred-weight Feast. But that was short of the mark, for twenty guests were invited and there were several meals at which it snowed food and rained drink, as hobbits say.

Some people were rather shocked; but Frodo kept up the custom of giving Bilbo’s Birthday Party year after year until they got used to it. He said that he did not think Bilbo was dead. When they asked: ‘Where is he then?’ he shrugged his shoulders.

He lived alone, as Bilbo had done; but he had a good many friends, especially among the younger hobbits (mostly descendants of the Old Took) who had as children been fond of Bilbo and often in and out of Bag End. Folco Boffin and Fredegar Bolger were two of these; but his closest friends were Peregrin Took (usually called Pippin), and Merry Brandybuck (his real name was Meriadoc, but that was seldom remembered). Frodo went tramping all over the Shire with them; but more often he wandered by himself, and to the amazement of sensible folk he was sometimes seen far from home walking in the hills and woods under the starlight. Merry and Pippin suspected that he visited the Elves at times, as Bilbo had done.

As time went on, people began to notice that Frodo also showed signs of good ‘preservation’: outwardly he retained the appearance of a robust and energetic hobbit just out of his tweens. ‘Some folk have all the luck,’ they said; but it was not until Frodo approached the usually more sober age of fifty that they began to think it queer.

Frodo himself, after the first shock, found that being his own master and the Mr. Baggins of Bag End was rather pleasant. For some years he was quite happy and did not worry much about the future. But half unknown to himself the regret that he had not gone with Bilbo was steadily growing. He found himself wondering at times, especially in the autumn, about the wild lands, and strange visions of mountains that he had never seen came into his dreams. He began to say to himself: ‘Perhaps I shall cross the River myself one day.’ To which the other half of his mind always replied: ‘Not yet.’

So it went on, until his forties were running out, and his fiftieth birthday was drawing near: fifty was a number that he felt was somehow significant (or ominous); it was at any rate at that age that adventure had suddenly befallen Bilbo. Frodo began to feel restless, and the old paths seemed too well-trodden. He looked at maps, and wondered what lay beyond their edges: maps made in the Shire showed mostly white spaces beyond its borders. He took to wandering further afield and more often by himself; and Merry and his other friends watched him anxiously. Often he was seen walking and talking with the strange wayfarers that began at this time to appear in the Shire.

There were rumours of strange things happening in the world outside; and as Gandalf had not at that time appeared or sent any message for several years, Frodo gathered all the news he could. Elves, who seldom walked in the Shire, could now be seen passing westward through the woods in the evening, passing and not returning; but they were leaving Middle-earth and were no longer concerned with its troubles. There were, however, dwarves on the road in unusual numbers. The ancient East-West Road ran through the Shire to its end at the Grey Havens, and dwarves had always used it on their way to their mines in the Blue Mountains. They were the hobbits’ chief source of news from distant parts - if they wanted any: as a rule dwarves said little and hobbits asked no more. But now Frodo often met strange dwarves of far countries, seeking refuge in the West. They were troubled, and some spoke in whispers of the Enemy and of the Land of Mordor.

That name the hobbits only knew in legends of the dark past, like a shadow in the background of their memories; but it was ominous and disquieting. It seemed that the evil power in Mirkwood had been driven out by the White Council only to reappear in greater strength in the old strongholds of Mordor. The Dark Tower had been rebuilt, it was said. From there the power was spreading far and wide, and away far east and south there were wars and growing fear. Orcs were multiplying again in the mountains. Trolls were abroad, no longer dull-witted, but cunning and armed with dreadful weapons. And there were murmured hints of creatures more terrible than all these, but they had no name.

Little of all this, of course, reached the ears of ordinary hobbits. But even the deafest and most stay-at-home began to hear queer tales; and those whose business took them to the borders saw strange things. The conversation in The Green Dragon at Bywater, one evening in the spring of Frodo’s fiftieth year, showed that even in the comfortable heart of the Shire rumours had been heard, though most hobbits still laughed at them.

Sam Gamgee was sitting in one corner near the fire, and opposite him was Ted Sandyman, the miller’s son; and there were various other rustic hobbits listening to their talk.

‘Queer things you do hear these days, to be sure,’ said Sam.

‘Ah,’ said Ted, ‘you do, if you listen. But I can hear fireside-tales and children’s stories at home, if I want to.’

‘No doubt you can,’ retorted Sam, ‘and I daresay there’s more truth in some of them than you reckon. Who invented the stories anyway? Take dragons now.’

‘No thank ’ee,’ said Ted, ‘I won’t. I heard tell of them when I was a youngster, but there’s no call to believe in them now. There’s only one Dragon in Bywater, and that’s Green,’ he said, getting a general laugh.

‘All right,’ said Sam, laughing with the rest. ‘But what about these Tree-men, these giants, as you might call them? They do say that one bigger than a tree was seen up away beyond the North Moors not long back.’

‘Who’s they?’

‘My cousin Hal for one. He works for Mr. Boffin at Overhill and goes up to the Northfarthing for the hunting. He saw one.’

‘Says he did, perhaps. Your Hal’s always saying he’s seen things; and maybe he sees things that ain’t there.’

‘But this one was as big as an elm tree, and walking - walking seven yards to a stride, if it was an inch.’

‘Then I bet it wasn’t an inch. What he saw was an elm tree, as like as not.’

‘But this one was walking, I tell you; and there ain’t no elm tree on the North Moors.’

‘Then Hal can’t have seen one,’ said Ted. There was some laughing and clapping: the audience seemed to think that Ted had scored a point.

‘All the same,’ said Sam, ‘you can’t deny that others besides our Halfast have seen queer folk crossing the Shire - crossing it, mind you: there are more that are turned back at the borders. The Bounders have never been so busy before.

‘And I’ve heard tell that Elves are moving west. They do say they are going to the harbours, out away beyond the White Towers.’ Sam waved his arm vaguely: neither he nor any of them knew how far it was to the Sea, past the old towers beyond the western borders of the Shire. But it was an old tradition that away over there stood the Grey Havens, from which at times elven-ships set sail, never to return.

‘They are sailing, sailing, sailing over the Sea, they are going into the West and leaving us,’ said Sam, half chanting the words, shaking his head sadly and solemnly. But Ted laughed.

‘Well, that isn’t anything new, if you believe the old tales. And I don’t see what it matters to me or you. Let them sail! But I warrant you haven’t seen them doing it; nor any one else in the Shire.’

‘Well I don’t know,’ said Sam thoughtfully. He believed he had once seen an Elf in the woods, and still hoped to see more one day. Of all the legends that he had heard in his early years such fragments of tales and half-remembered stories about the Elves as the hobbits knew, had always moved him most deeply. ‘There are some, even in these parts, as know the Fair Folk and get news of them,’ he said. ‘There’s Mr. Baggins now, that I work for. He told me that they were sailing and he knows a bit about Elves. And old Mr. Bilbo knew more: many’s the talk I had with him when I was a little lad.’

‘Oh, they’re both cracked,’ said Ted. ‘Leastways old Bilbo was cracked, and Frodo’s cracking. If that’s where you get your news from, you’ll never want for moonshine. Well, friends, I’m off home. Your good health!’ He drained his mug and went out noisily.

Sam sat silent and said no more. He had a good deal to think about. For one thing, there was a lot to do up in the Bag End garden, and he would have a busy day tomorrow, if the weather cleared. The grass was growing fast. But Sam had more on his mind than gardening. After a while he sighed, and got up and went out.

It was early April and the sky was now clearing after heavy rain. The sun was down, and a cool pale evening was quietly fading into night. He walked home under the early stars through Hobbiton and up the Hill, whistling softly and thoughtfully.

It was just at this time that Gandalf reappeared after his long absence. For three years after the Party he had been away. Then he paid Frodo a brief visit, and after taking a good look at him he went off again. During the next year or two he had turned up fairly often, coming unexpectedly after dusk, and going off without warning before sunrise. He would not discuss his own business and journeys, and seemed chiefly interested in small news about Frodo’s health and doings.

Then suddenly his visits had ceased. It was over nine years since Frodo had seen or heard of him, and he had begun to think that the wizard would never return and had given up all interest in hobbits. But that evening, as Sam was walking home and twilight was fading, there came the once familiar tap on the study window.

Frodo welcomed his old friend with surprise and great delight. They looked hard at one another.

‘Ah well eh?’ said Gandalf. ‘You look the same as ever, Frodo!’

‘So do you,’ Frodo replied; but secretly he thought that Gandalf looked older and more careworn. He pressed him for news of himself and of the wide world, and soon they were deep in talk, and they stayed up far into the night.

Next morning after a late breakfast, the wizard was sitting with Frodo by the open window of the study. A bright fire was on the hearth, but the sun was warm, and the wind was in the South. Everything looked fresh, and the new green of Spring was shimmering in the fields and on the tips of the trees’ fingers.

Gandalf was thinking of a spring, nearly eighty years before, when Bilbo had run out of Bag End without a handkerchief. His hair was perhaps whiter than it had been then, and his beard and eyebrows were perhaps longer, and his face more lined with care and wisdom; but his eyes were as bright as ever, and he smoked and blew smoke-rings with the same vigour and delight.

He was smoking now in silence, for Frodo was sitting still, deep in thought. Even in the light of morning he felt the dark shadow of the tidings that Gandalf had brought. At last he broke the silence.

‘Last night you began to tell me strange things about my ring, Gandalf,’ he said. ‘And then you stopped, because you said that such matters were best left until daylight. Don’t you think you had better finish now? You say the ring is dangerous, far more dangerous than I guess. In what way?’

‘In many ways,’ answered the wizard. It is far more powerful than I ever dared to think at first, so powerful that in the end it would utterly overcome anyone of mortal race who possessed it. It would possess him.

‘In Eregion long ago many Elven-rings were made, magic rings as you call them, and they were, of course, of various kinds: some more potent and some less. The lesser rings were only essays in the craft before it was full-grown, and to the Elven-smiths they were but trifles - yet still to my mind dangerous for mortals. But the Great Rings, the Rings of Power, they were perilous.

‘A mortal, Frodo, who keeps one of the Great Rings, does not die, but he does not grow or obtain more life, he merely continues, until at last every minute is a weariness. And if he often uses the Ring to make himself invisible, he fades: he becomes in the end invisible permanently, and walks in the twilight under the eye of the dark power that rules the Rings. Yes, sooner or later - later, if he is strong or well-meaning to begin with, but neither strength nor good purpose will last - sooner or later the dark power will devour him.’

‘How terrifying!’ said Frodo. There was another long silence. The sound of Sam Gamgee cutting the lawn came in from the garden.

‘How long have you known this?’ asked Frodo at length. ‘And how much did Bilbo know?’

‘Bilbo knew no more than he told you, I am sure,’ said Gandalf. ‘He would certainly never have passed on to you anything that he thought would be a danger, even though I promised to look after you. He thought the ring was very beautiful, and very useful at need; and if anything was wrong or queer, it was himself. He said that it was “growing on his mind”, and he was always worrying about it; but he did not suspect that the ring itself was to blame. Though he had found out that the thing needed looking after; it did not seem always of the same size or weight; it shrank or expanded in an odd way, and might suddenly slip off a finger where it had been tight.’

‘Yes, he warned me of that in his last letter,’ said Frodo, ‘so I have always kept it on its chain.’

‘Very wise,’ said Gandalf. ‘But as for his long life, Bilbo never connected it with the ring at all. He took all the credit for that to himself, and he was very proud of it. Though he was getting restless and uneasy. Thin and stretched he said. A sign that the ring was getting control.’

‘How long have you known all this?’ asked Frodo again.

‘Known?’ said Gandalf. ‘I have known much that only the Wise know, Frodo. But if you mean “known about this ring”, well, I still do not know, one might say. There is a last test to make. But I no longer doubt my guess.

‘When did I first begin to guess?’ he mused, searching back in memory. ‘Let me see - it was in the year that the White Council drove the dark power from Mirkwood, just before the Battle of Five Armies, that Bilbo found his ring. A shadow fell on my heart then, though I did not know yet what I feared. I wondered often how Gollum came by a Great Ring, as plainly it was - that at least was clear from the first. Then I heard Bilbo’s strange story of how he had “won” it, and I could not believe it. When I at last got the truth out of him, I saw at once that he had been trying to put his claim to the ring beyond doubt. Much like Gollum with his “birthday present”. The lies were too much alike for my comfort. Clearly the ring had an unwholesome power that set to work on its keeper at once. That was the first real warning I had that all was not well. I told Bilbo often that such rings were better left unused; but he resented it, and soon got angry. There was little else that I could do. I could not take it from him without doing greater harm; and I had no right to do so anyway. I could only watch and wait. I might perhaps have consulted Saruman the White, but something always held me back.’

‘Who is he?’ asked Frodo. I have never heard of him before.’

‘Maybe not,’ answered Gandalf. ‘Hobbits are, or were, no concern of his. Yet he is great among the Wise. He is the chief of my order and the head of the Council. His knowledge is deep, but his pride has grown with it, and he takes ill any meddling. The lore of the Elven-rings, great and small, is his province. He has long studied it, seeking the lost secrets of their making; but when the Rings were debated in the Council, all that he would reveal to us of his ring-lore told against my fears. So my doubt slept - but uneasily. Still I watched and I waited.

‘And all seemed well with Bilbo. And the years passed. Yes, they passed, and they seemed not to touch him. He showed no signs of age. The shadow fell on me again. But I said to myself: “After all he comes of a long-lived family on his mother’s side. There is time yet. Wait!”

‘And I waited. Until that night when he left this house. He said and did things then that filled me with a fear that no words of Saruman could allay. I knew at last that something dark and deadly was at work. And I have spent most of the years since then in finding out the truth of it.’

‘There wasn’t any permanent harm done, was there?’ asked Frodo anxiously. ‘He would get all right in time, wouldn’t he? Be able to rest in peace, I mean?’

‘He felt better at once,’ said Gandalf. ‘But there is only one Power in this world that knows all about the Rings and their effects; and as far as I know there is no Power in the world that knows all about hobbits. Among the Wise I am the only one that goes in for hobbit-lore: an obscure branch of knowledge, but full of surprises. Soft as butter they can be, and yet sometimes as tough as old tree-roots. I think it likely that some would resist the Rings far longer than most of the Wise would believe. I don’t think you need worry about Bilbo.

‘Of course, he possessed the ring for many years, and used it, so it might take a long while for the influence to wear off - before it was safe for him to see it again, for instance. Otherwise, he might live on for years, quite happily: just stop as he was when he parted with it. For he gave it up in the end of his own accord: an important point. No, I was not troubled about dear Bilbo any more, once he had let the thing go. It is for you that I feel responsible.

‘Ever since Bilbo left I have been deeply concerned about you, and about all these charming, absurd, helpless hobbits. It would be a grievous blow to the world, if the Dark Power overcame the Shire; if all your kind, jolly, stupid Bolgers, Hornblowers, Boffins, Bracegirdles, and the rest, not to mention the ridiculous Bagginses, became enslaved.’

Frodo shuddered. ‘But why should we be?’ he asked. ‘And why should he want such slaves?’

‘To tell you the truth,’ replied Gandalf, ‘I believe that hitherto - hitherto, mark you - he has entirely overlooked the existence of hobbits. You should be thankful. But your safety has passed. He does not need you - he has many more useful servants - but he won’t forget you again. And hobbits as miserable slaves would please him far more than hobbits happy and free. There is such a thing as malice and revenge.’

‘Revenge?’ said Frodo. ‘Revenge for what? I still don’t understand what all this has to do with Bilbo and myself, and our ring.’

‘It has everything to do with it,’ said Gandalf. ‘You do not know the real peril yet; but you shall. I was not sure of it myself when I was last here; but the time has come to speak. Give me the ring for a moment.’

Frodo took it from his breeches-pocket, where it was clasped to a chain that hung from his belt. He unfastened it and handed it slowly to the wizard. It felt suddenly very heavy, as if either it or Frodo himself was in some way reluctant for Gandalf to touch it.

Gandalf held it up. It looked to be made of pure and solid gold. ‘Can you see any markings on it?’ he asked.

‘No,’ said Frodo. ‘There are none. It is quite plain, and it never shows a scratch or sign of wear.’

‘Well then, look!’ To Frodo’s astonishment and distress the wizard threw it suddenly into the middle of a glowing corner of the fire. Frodo gave a cry and groped for the tongs; but Gandalf held him back.

‘Wait!’ he said in a commanding voice, giving Frodo a quick look from under his bristling brows.

No apparent change came over the ring. After a while Gandalf got up, closed the shutters outside the window, and drew the curtains. The room became dark and silent, though the clack of Sam’s shears, now nearer to the windows, could still be heard faintly from the garden. For a moment the wizard stood looking at the fire; then he stooped and removed the ring to the hearth with the tongs, and at once picked it up. Frodo gasped.

It is quite cool,’ said Gandalf. ‘Take it!’ Frodo received it on his shrinking palm: it seemed to have become thicker and heavier than ever.

‘Hold it up!’ said Gandalf. ‘And look closely!’

As Frodo did so, he now saw fine lines, finer than the finest pen-strokes, running along the ring, outside and inside: lines of fire that seemed to form the letters of a flowing script. They shone piercingly bright, and yet remote, as if out of a great depth.



I cannot read the fiery letters,’ said Frodo in a quavering voice.

‘No,’ said Gandalf, ‘but I can. The letters are Elvish, of an ancient mode, but the language is that of Mordor, which I will not utter here. But this in the Common Tongue is what is said, close enough:

One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them,

One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them.

It is only two lines of a verse long known in Elven-lore:

Three Rings for the Elven-kings under the sky,

Seven for the Dwarf-lords in their halls of stone,

Nine for Mortal Men doomed to die,

One for the Dark Lord on his dark throne

In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie.

One Ring to rule them all. One Ring to find them,

One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them

In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie.’

He paused, and then said slowly in a deep voice: ‘This is the Master-ring, the One Ring to rule them all. This is the One Ring that he lost many ages ago, to the great weakening of his power. He greatly desires it - but he must not get it.’

Frodo sat silent and motionless. Fear seemed to stretch out a vast hand, like a dark cloud rising in the East and looming up to engulf him. ‘This ring!’ he stammered. ‘How, how on earth did it come to me?’

‘Ah!’ said Gandalf. ‘That is a very long story. The beginnings lie back in the Black Years, which only the lore-masters now remember. If I were to tell you all that tale, we should still be sitting here when Spring had passed into Winter.

‘But last night I told you of Sauron the Great, the Dark Lord. The rumours that you have heard are true: he has indeed arisen again and left his hold in Mirkwood and returned to his ancient fastness in the Dark Tower of Mordor. That name even you hobbits have heard of, like a shadow on the borders of old stories. Always after a defeat and a respite, the Shadow takes another shape and grows again.’

‘I wish it need not have happened in my time,’ said Frodo.

‘So do I,’ said Gandalf, ‘and so do all who live to see such times. But that is not for them to decide. All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given, us. And already, Frodo, our time is beginning to look black. The Enemy is fast becoming very strong. His plans are far from ripe, I think, but they are ripening. We shall be hard put to it. We should be very hard put to it, even if it were not for this dreadful chance.

‘The Enemy still lacks one thing to give him strength and knowledge to beat down all resistance, break the last defences, and cover all the lands in a second darkness. He lacks the One Ring.

‘The Three, fairest of all, the Elf-lords hid from him, and his hand never touched them or sullied them. Seven the Dwarf-kings possessed, but three he has recovered, and the others the dragons have consumed. Nine he gave to Mortal Men, proud and great, and so ensnared them. Long ago they fell under the dominion of the One, and they became Ringwraiths, shadows under his great Shadow, his most terrible servants. Long ago. It is many a year since the Nine walked abroad. Yet who knows? As the Shadow grows once more, they too may walk again. But come! We will not speak of such things even in the morning of the Shire.

‘So it is now: the Nine he has gathered to himself; the Seven also, or else they are destroyed. The Three are hidden still. But that no longer troubles him. He only needs the One; for he made that Ring himself, it is his, and he let a great part of his own former power pass into it, so that he could rule all the others. If he recovers it, then he will command them all again, wherever they be, even the Three, and all that has been wrought with them will be laid bare, and he will be stronger than ever.

‘And this is the dreadful chance, Frodo. He believed that the One had perished; that the Elves had destroyed it, as should have been done. But he knows now that it has not perished, that it has been found. So he is seeking it, seeking it, and all his thought is bent on it. It is his great hope and our great fear.’

‘Why, why wasn’t it destroyed?’ cried Frodo. ‘And how did the Enemy ever come to lose it, if he was so strong, and it was so precious to him?’ He clutched the Ring in his hand, as if he saw already dark fingers stretching out to seize it.

‘It was taken from him,’ said Gandalf. ‘The strength of the Elves to resist him was greater long ago; and not all Men were estranged from them. The Men of Westernesse came to their aid. That is a chapter of ancient history which it might be good to recall; for there was sorrow then too, and gathering dark, but great valour, and great deeds that were not wholly vain. One day, perhaps, I will tell you all the tale, or you shall hear it told in full by one who knows it best.

‘But for the moment, since most of all you need to know how this thing came to you, and that will be tale enough, this is all that I will say. It was Gil-galad, Elven-king and Elendil of Westernesse who overthrew Sauron, though they themselves perished in the deed; and Isildur Elendil’s son cut the Ring from Sauron’s hand and took it for his own. Then Sauron was vanquished and his spirit fled and was hidden for long years, until his shadow took shape again in Mirkwood.

‘But the Ring was lost. It fell into the Great River, Anduin, and vanished. For Isildur was marching north along the east banks of the River, and near the Gladden Fields he was waylaid by the Orcs of the Mountains, and almost all his folk were slain. He leaped into the waters, but the Ring slipped from his finger as he swam, and then the Orcs saw him and killed him with arrows.’

Gandalf paused. ‘And there in the dark pools amid the Gladden Fields,’ he said, ‘the Ring passed out of knowledge and legend; and even so much of its history is known now only to a few, and the Council of the Wise could discover no more. But at last I can carry on the story, I think.

‘Long after, but still very long ago, there lived by the banks of the Great River on the edge of Wilderland a clever-handed and quiet-footed little people. I guess they were of hobbit-kind; akin to the fathers of the fathers of the Stoors, for they loved the River, and often swam in it, or made little boats of reeds. There was among them a family of high repute, for it was large and wealthier than most, and it was ruled by a grandmother of the folk, stern and wise in old lore, such as they had. The most inquisitive and curious-minded of that family was called Smeagol. He was interested in roots and beginnings; he dived into deep pools; he burrowed under trees and growing plants; he tunnelled into green mounds; and he ceased to look up at the hill-tops, or the leaves on trees, or the flowers opening in the air: his head and his eyes were downward.

‘He had a friend called Deagol, of similar sort, sharper-eyed but not so quick and strong. On a time they took a boat and went down to the Gladden Fields, where there were great beds of iris and flowering reeds. There Smeagol got out and went nosing about the banks but Deagol sat in the boat and fished. Suddenly a great fish took his hook, and before he knew where he was, he was dragged out and down into the water, to the bottom. Then he let go of his line, for he thought he saw something shining in the river-bed; and holding his breath he grabbed at it.

‘Then up he came spluttering, with weeds in his hair and a handful of mud; and he swam to the bank. And behold! when he washed the mud away, there in his hand lay a beautiful golden ring; and it shone and glittered in the sun, so that his heart was glad. But Smeagol had been watching him from behind a tree, and as Deagol gloated over the ring, Smeagol came softly up behind.

‘“Give us that, Deagol, my love,” said Smeagol, over his friend’s shoulder.

‘“Why?” said Deagol.

‘ “Because it’s my birthday, my love, and I wants it,” said Smeagol.

‘“I don’t care,” said Deagol. “I have given you a present already, more than I could afford. I found this, and I’m going to keep it.”

‘ “Oh, are you indeed, my love,” said Smeagol; and he caught Deagol by the throat and strangled him, because the gold looked so bright and beautiful. Then he put the ring on his finger.

‘No one ever found out what had become of Deagol; he was murdered far from home, and his body was cunningly hidden. But Smeagol returned alone; and he found that none of his family could see him, when he was wearing the ring. He was very pleased with his discovery and he concealed it; and he used it to find out secrets, and he put his knowledge to crooked and malicious uses. He became sharp-eyed and keen-eared for all that was hurtful. The ring had given him power according to his stature. It is not to be wondered at that he became very unpopular and was shunned (when visible) by all his relations. They kicked him, and he bit their feet. He took to thieving, and going about muttering to himself, and gurgling in his throat. So they called him Gollum, and cursed him, and told him to go far away; and his grandmother, desiring peace, expelled him from the family and turned him out of her hole.

‘He wandered in loneliness, weeping a little for the hardness of the world, and he journeyed up the River, till he came to a stream that flowed down from the mountains, and he went that way. He caught fish in deep pools with invisible fingers and ate them raw. One day it was very hot, and as he was bending over a pool, he felt a burning on the back of his head) and a dazzling light from the water pained his wet eyes. He wondered at it, for he had almost forgotten about the Sun. Then for the last time he looked up and shook his fist at her.

‘But as he lowered his eyes, he saw far above the tops of the Misty Mountains, out of which the stream came. And he thought suddenly: “It would be cool and shady under those mountains. The Sun could not watch me there. The roots of those mountains must be roots indeed; there must be great secrets buried there which have not been discovered since the beginning.”

‘So he journeyed by night up into the highlands, and he found a little cave out of which the dark stream ran; and he wormed his way like a maggot into the heart of the hills, and vanished out of all knowledge. The Ring went into the shadows with him, and even the maker, when his power had begun to grow again, could learn nothing of it.’

‘Gollum!’ cried Frodo. ‘Gollum? Do you mean that this is the very Gollum-creature that Bilbo met? How loathsome!’

‘I think it is a sad story,’ said the wizard, ‘and it might have happened to others, even to some hobbits that I have known.’

‘I can’t believe that Gollum was connected with hobbits, however distantly,’ said Frodo with some heat. ‘What an abominable notion!’

‘It is true all the same,’ replied Gandalf. ‘About their origins, at any rate, I know more than hobbits do themselves. And even Bilbo’s story suggests the kinship. There was a great deal in the background of their minds and memories that was very similar. They understood one another remarkably well, very much better than a hobbit would understand, say, a Dwarf, or an Orc, or even an Elf. Think of the riddles they both knew, for one thing.’

‘Yes,’ said Frodo. ‘Though other folks besides hobbits ask riddles, and of much the same sort. And hobbits don’t cheat. Gollum meant to cheat all the time. He was just trying to put poor Bilbo off his guard. And I daresay it amused his wickedness to start a game which might end in providing him with an easy victim, but if he lost would not hurt him.’

‘Only too true, I fear,’ said Gandalf. ‘But there was something else in it, I think, which you don’t see yet. Even Gollum was not wholly ruined. He had proved tougher than even one of the Wise would have guessed -as a hobbit might. There was a little corner of his mind that was still his own, and light came through it, as through a chink in the dark: light out of the past. It was actually pleasant, I think, to hear a kindly voice again, bringing up memories of wind, and trees, and sun on the grass, and such forgotten things.

‘But that, of course, would only make the evil part of him angrier in the end - unless it could be conquered. Unless it could be cured.’ Gandalf sighed. ‘Alas! there is little hope of that for him. Yet not no hope. No, not though he possessed the Ring so long, almost as far back as he can remember. For it was long since he had worn it much: in the black darkness it was seldom needed. Certainly he had never “faded”. He is thin and tough still. But the thing was eating up his mind, of course, and the torment had become almost unbearable.

‘All the “great secrets” under the mountains had turned out to be just empty night: there was nothing more to find out, nothing worth doing, only nasty furtive eating and resentful remembering. He was altogether wretched. He hated the dark, and he hated light more: he hated everything, and the Ring most of all.’

‘What do you mean?’ said Frodo. ‘Surely the Ring was his precious and the only thing he cared for? But if he hated it, why didn’t he get rid of it, or go away and leave it?’

‘You ought to begin to understand, Frodo, after all you have heard,’ said Gandalf. ‘He hated it and loved it, as he hated and loved himself. He could not get rid of it. He had no will left in the matter.

‘A Ring of Power looks after itself, Frodo. It may slip off treacherously, but its keeper never abandons it. At most he plays with the idea of handing it on to someone else’s care - and that only at an early stage, when it first begins to grip. But as far as I know Bilbo alone in history has ever gone beyond playing, and really done it. He needed all my help, too. And even so he would never have just forsaken it, or cast it aside. It was not Gollum, Frodo, but the Ring itself that decided things. The Ring left him.’

‘What, just in time to meet Bilbo?’ said Frodo. ‘Wouldn’t an Orc have suited it better?’

‘It is no laughing matter,’ said Gandalf. ‘Not for you. It was the strangest event in the whole history of the Ring so far: Bilbo’s arrival just at that time, and putting his hand on it, blindly, in the dark.

‘There was more than one power at work, Frodo. The Ring was trying to get back to its master. It had slipped from Isildur’s hand and betrayed him; then when a chance came it caught poor Deagol, and he was murdered; and after that Gollum, and it had devoured him. It could make no further use of him: he was too small and mean; and as long as it stayed with him he would never leave his deep pool again. So now, when its master was awake once more and sending out his dark thought from Mirkwood, it abandoned Gollum. Only to be picked up by the most unlikely person imaginable: Bilbo from the Shire!

‘Behind that there was something else at work, beyond any design of the Ring-maker. I can put it no plainer than by saying that Bilbo was meant to find the Ring, and not by its maker. In which case you also were meant to have it. And that maybe an encouraging thought.’

''It is not,’ said Frodo. “Though I am not sure that I understand you. But how have you learned all this about the Ring, and about Gollum? Do you really know it all, or are you just guessing still?’

Gandalf looked at Frodo, and his eyes glinted. I knew much and I have learned much,’ he answered. ‘But I am not going to give an account of all my doings to you. The history of Elendil and Isildur and the One Ring is known to all the Wise. Your ring is shown to be that One Ring by the fire-writing alone, apart from any other evidence.’ ‘And when did you discover that?’ asked Frodo, interrupting. ‘Just now in this room, of course,’ answered the wizard sharply. ‘But I expected to find it. I have come back from dark journeys and long search to make that final test. It is the last proof, and all is now only too clear. Making out Gollum’s part, and fitting it into the gap in the history, required some thought. I may have started with guesses about Gollum, but I am not guessing now. I know. I have seen him.’

‘You have seen Gollum?’ exclaimed Frodo in amazement.

‘Yes. The obvious thing to do, of course, if one could. I tried long ago; but I have managed it at last.’

‘Then what happened after Bilbo escaped from him? Do you know that?’

‘Not so clearly. What I have told you is what Gollum was willing to tell - though not, of course, in the way I have reported it. Gollum is a liar, and you have to sift his words. For instance, he called the Ring his “birthday present”, and he stuck to that. He said it came from his grandmother, who had lots of beautiful things of that kind. A ridiculous story. I have no doubt that Smeagol''s grandmother was a matriarch, a great person in her way, but to talk of her possessing many Elven-rings was absurd, and as for giving them away, it was a lie. But a lie with a grain of truth.

‘The murder of Deagol haunted Gollum, and he had made up a defence, repeating it to his “precious” over and over again, as he gnawed bones in the dark, until he almost believed it. It was his birthday. Deagol ought to have given the ring to him. It had previously turned up just so as to be a present. It was his birthday present, and so on, and on.

''I endured him as long as I could, but the truth was desperately important, and in the end I had to be harsh. I put the fear of fire on him, and wrung the true story out of him, bit by bit, together with much snivelling and snarling. He thought he was misunderstood and ill-used. But when he had at last told me his history, as far as the end of the Riddle-game and Bilbo’s escape, he would not say any more, except in dark hints. Some other fear was on him greater than mine. He muttered that he was going to gel his own back. People would see if he would stand being kicked, and driven into a hole and then robbed. Gollum had good friends now, good friends and very strong. They would help him. Baggins would pay for it. That was his chief thought. He hated Bilbo and cursed his name. What is more, he knew where he came from.’

‘But how did he find that out?’ asked Frodo.

‘Well, as for the name, Bilbo very foolishly told Gollum himself; and after that it would not be difficult to discover his country, once Gollum came out. Oh yes, he came out. His longing for the Ring proved stronger than his fear of the Orcs, or even of the light. After a year or two he left the mountains. You see, though still bound by desire of it, the Ring was no longer devouring him; he began to revive a little. He felt old, terribly old, yet less timid, and he was mortally hungry.

‘Light, light of Sun and Moon, he still feared and hated, and he always will, I think; but he was cunning. He found he could hide from daylight and moonshine, and make his way swiftly and softly by dead of night with his pale cold eyes, and catch small frightened or unwary things. He grew stronger and bolder with new food and new air. He found his way into Mirkwood, as one would expect.’

‘Is that where you found him?’ asked Frodo.

‘I saw him there,’ answered Gandalf, ‘but before that he had wandered far, following Bilbo’s trail. It was difficult to learn anything from him for certain, for his talk was constantly interrupted by curses and threats. “What had it got in its pocketses?” he said. “It wouldn’t say, no precious. Little cheat. Not a fair question. It cheated first, it did. It broke the rules. We ought to have squeezed it, yes precious. And we will, precious!”

‘That is a sample of his talk. I don’t suppose you want any more. I had weary days of it. But from hints dropped among the snarls I even gathered that his padding feet had taken him at last to Esgaroth, and even to the streets of Dale, listening secretly and peering. Well, the news of the great events went far and wide in Wilderland, and many had heard Bilbo’s name and knew where he came from. We had made no secret of our return journey to his home in the West. Gollum’s sharp ears would soon learn what he wanted.’

‘Then why didn’t he track Bilbo further?’ asked Frodo. ‘Why didn’t he come to the Shire?’

‘Ah,’ said Gandalf, ‘now we come to it. I think Gollum tried to. He set out and came back westward, as far as the Great River. But then he turned aside. He was not daunted by the distance, I am sure. No, something else drew him away. So my friends think, those that hunted him for me.

‘The Wood-elves tracked him first, an easy task for them, for his trail was still fresh then. Through Mirkwood and back again it led them, though they never caught him. The wood was full of the rumour of him, dreadful tales even among beasts and birds. The Woodmen said that there was some new terror abroad, a ghost that drank blood. It climbed trees to find nests; it crept into holes to find the young; it slipped through windows to find cradles.

‘But at the western edge of Mirkwood the trail turned away. It wandered off southwards and passed out of the Wood-elves’ ken, and was lost. And then I made a great mistake. Yes, Frodo, and not the first; though I fear it may prove the worst. I let the matter be. I let him go; for I had much else to think of at that time, and I still trusted the lore of Saruman.

‘Well, that was years ago. I have paid for it since with many dark and dangerous days. The trail was long cold when I took it up again, after Bilbo left here. And my search would have been in vain, but for the help that I had from a friend: Aragorn, the greatest traveller and huntsman of this age of the world. Together we sought for Gollum down the whole length of Wilderland, without hope, and without success. But at last, when I had given up the chase and turned to other parts, Gollum was found. My friend returned out of the great perils bringing the miserable creature with him.

‘What he had been doing he would not say. He only wept and called us cruel, with many a gollum in his throat; and when we pressed him he whined and cringed, and rubbed his long hands, licking his fingers as if they pained him, as if he remembered some old torture. But I am afraid there is no possible doubt: he had made his slow, sneaking way, step by step, mile by mile, south, down at last to the Land of Mordor.’

A heavy silence fell in the room. Frodo could hear his heart beating. Even outside everything seemed still. No sound of Sam’s shears could now be heard.

‘Yes, to Mordor,’ said Gandalf. ‘Alas! Mordor draws all wicked things, and the Dark Power was bending all its will to gather them there. The Ring of the Enemy would leave its mark, too, leave him open to the summons. And all folk were whispering then of the new Shadow in the South, and its hatred of the West. There were his fine new friends, who would help him in his revenge!

‘Wretched fool! In that land he would learn much, too much for his comfort. And sooner or later as he lurked and pried on the borders he would be caught, and taken - for examination. That was the way of it, I fear. When he was found he had already been there long, and was on his way back. On some errand of mischief. But that does not matter much now. His worst mischief was done.

‘Yes, alas! through him the Enemy has learned that the One has been found again. He knows where Isildur fell. He knows where Gollum found his ring. He knows that it is a Great Ring, for it gave long life. He knows that it is not one of the Three, for they have never been lost, and they endure no evil. He knows that it is not one of the Seven, or the Nine, for they are accounted for. He knows that it is the One. And he has at last heard, I think, of hobbits and the Shire.

‘The Shire - he may be seeking for it now, if he has not already found out where it lies. Indeed, Frodo, I fear that he may even think that the long-unnoticed name of Baggins has become important.’

‘But this is terrible!’ cried Frodo. ‘Far worse than the worst that I imagined from your hints and warnings. O Gandalf, best of friends, what am I to do? For now I am really afraid. What am I to do? What a pity that Bilbo did not stab that vile creature, when he had a chance!’

‘Pity? It was Pity that stayed his hand. Pity, and Mercy: not to strike without need. And he has been well rewarded, Frodo. Be sure that he took so little hurt from the evil, and escaped in the end, because he began his ownership of the Ring so. With Pity.’

‘I am sorry,’ said Frodo. ‘But I am frightened; and I do not feel any pity for Gollum.’

‘You have not seen him,’ Gandalf broke in.

‘No, and I don’t want to,’ said Frodo. I can’t understand you. Do you mean to say that you, and the Elves, have let him live on after all those horrible deeds? Now at any rate he is as bad as an Orc, and just an enemy. He deserves death.’

‘Deserves it! I daresay he does. Many that live deserve death. And some that die deserve life. Can you give it to them? Then do not be too eager to deal out death in judgement. For even the very wise cannot see all ends. I have not much hope that Gollum can be cured before he dies, but there is a chance of it. And he is bound up with the fate of the Ring. My heart tells me that he has some part to play yet, for good or ill, before the end; and when that comes, the pity of Bilbo may rule the fate of many - yours not least. In any case we did not kill him: he is very old and very wretched. The Wood-elves have him in prison, but they treat him with such kindness as they can find in their wise hearts.’

‘All the same,’ said Frodo, ‘even if Bilbo could not kill Gollum, I wish he had not kept the Ring. I wish he had never found it, and that I had not got it! Why did you let me keep it? Why didn’t you make me throw it away, or, or destroy it?’

‘Let you? Make you?’ said the wizard. ‘Haven’t you been listening to all that I have said? You are not thinking of what you are saying. But as for throwing it away, that was obviously wrong. These Rings have a way of being found. In evil hands it might have done great evil. Worst of all, it might have fallen into the hands of the Enemy. Indeed it certainly would; for this is the One, and he is exerting all his power to find it or draw it to himself.

‘Of course, my dear Frodo, it was dangerous for you; and that has troubled me deeply. But there was so much at stake that I had to take some risk - though even when I was far away there has never been a day when the Shire has not been guarded by watchful eyes. As long as you never used it, I did not think that the Ring would have any lasting effect on you, not for evil, not at any rate for a very long time. And you must remember that nine years ago, when I last saw you, I still knew little for certain.’

‘But why not destroy it, as you say should have been done long ago?’ cried Frodo again. If you had warned me, or even sent me a message, I would have done away with it.’

‘Would you? How would you do that? Have you ever tried?’

‘No. But I suppose one could hammer it or melt it.’

‘Try!’ said Gandalf. Try now!’

Frodo drew the Ring out of his pocket again and looked at it. It now appeared plain and smooth, without mark or device that he could see. The gold looked very fair and pure, and Frodo thought how rich and beautiful was its colour, how perfect was its roundness. It was an admirable thing and altogether precious. When he took it out he had intended to fling it from him into the very hottest part of the fire. But he found now that he could not do so, not without a great struggle. He weighed the Ring in his hand, hesitating, and forcing himself to remember all that Gandalf had told him; and then with an effort of will he made a movement, as if to cast it away - but he found that he had put it back in his pocket.

Gandalf laughed grimly. ‘You see? Already you too, Frodo, cannot easily let it go, nor will to damage it. And I could not “make” you - except by force, which would break your mind. But as for breaking the Ring, force is useless. Even if you took it and struck it with a heavy sledge-hammer, it would make no dint in it. It cannot be unmade by your hands, or by mine.

‘Your small fire, of course, would not melt even ordinary gold. This Ring has already passed through it unscathed, and even unheated. But there is no smith’s forge in this Shire that could change it at all. Not even the anvils and furnaces of the Dwarves could do that. It has been said that dragon-fire could melt and consume the Rings of Power, but there is not now any dragon left on earth in which the old fire is hot enough; nor was there ever any dragon, not even Ancalagon the Black, who could have harmed the One Ring, the Ruling Ring, for that was made by Sauron himself. There is only one way: to find the Cracks of Doom in the depths of Orodruin, the Fire-mountain, and cast the Ring in there, if you really wish to destroy it, to put it beyond the grasp of the Enemy for ever.’

‘I do really wish to destroy it!’ cried Frodo. ‘Or, well, to have it destroyed. I am not made for perilous quests. I wish I had never seen the Ring! Why did it come to me? Why was I chosen?’

‘Such questions cannot be answered,’ said Gandalf. ‘You may be sure that it was not for any merit that others do not possess: not for power or wisdom, at any rate. But you have been chosen, and you must therefore use such strength and heart and wits as you have.’

‘But I have so little of any of these things! You are wise and powerful. Will you not take the Ring?’

‘No!’ cried Gandalf, springing to his feet. ‘With that power I should have power too great and terrible. And over me the Ring would gain a power still greater and more deadly.’ His eyes flashed and his face was lit as by a fire within. ‘Do not tempt me! For I do not wish to become like the Dark Lord himself. Yet the way of the Ring to my heart is by pity, pity for weakness and the desire of strength to do good. Do not tempt me! I dare not take it, not even to keep it safe, unused. The wish to wield it would be too great, for my strength. I shall have such need of it. Great perils lie before me.’

He went to the window and drew aside the curtains and the shutters. Sunlight streamed back again into the room. Sam passed along the path outside whistling. ‘And now,’ said the wizard, turning back to Frodo, ‘the decision lies with you. But I will always help you.’ He laid his hand on Frodo’s shoulder. ‘I will help you bear this burden, as long as It is yours to bear. But we must do something, soon. The Enemy is moving.’

There was a long silence. Gandalf sat down again and puffed at his pipe, as if lost in thought. His eyes seemed closed, but under the lids he was watching Frodo intently. Frodo gazed fixedly at the red embers on the hearth, until they filled all his vision, and he seemed to be looking down into profound wells of fire. He was thinking of the fabled Cracks of Doom and the terror of the Fiery Mountain.

‘Well!’ said Gandalf at last. ‘What are you thinking about? Have you decided what to do?’

‘No!’ answered Frodo, coming back to himself out of darkness, and finding to his surprise that it was not dark, and that out of the window he could see the sunlit garden. ‘Or perhaps, yes. As far as I understand what you have said, I suppose I must keep the Ring and guard it, at least for the present, whatever it may do to me.’

‘Whatever it may do, it will be slow, slow to evil, if you keep it with that purpose,’ said Gandalf.

‘I hope so,’ said Frodo. ‘But I hope that you may find some other better keeper soon. But in the meanwhile it seems that I am a danger, a danger to all that live near me. I cannot keep the Ring and stay here. I ought to leave Bag End, leave the Shire, leave everything and go away.’ He sighed.

‘I should like to save the Shire, if I could - though there have been times when I thought the inhabitants too stupid and dull for words, and have felt that an earthquake or an invasion of dragons might be good for them. But I don’t feel like that now. I feel that as long as the Shire lies behind, safe and comfortable, I shall find wandering more bearable: I shall know that somewhere there is a firm foothold, even if my feet cannot stand there again.

‘Of course, I have sometimes thought of going away, but I imagined that as a kind of holiday, a series of adventures like Bilbo’s or better, ending in peace. But this would mean exile, a flight from danger into danger, drawing it after me. And I suppose I must go alone, if I am to do that and save the Shire. But I feel very small, and very uprooted, and well - desperate. The Enemy is so strong and terrible.’

He did not tell Gandalf, but as he was speaking a great desire to follow Bilbo flamed up in his heart - to follow Bilbo, and even perhaps to find him again. It was so strong that it overcame his fear: he could almost have run out there and then down the road without his hat, as Bilbo had done on a similar morning long ago.

‘My dear Frodo!’ exclaimed Gandalf. ‘Hobbits really are amazing creatures, as I have said before. You can learn all that there is to know about their ways in a month, and yet after a hundred years they can still surprise you at a pinch. I hardly expected to get such an answer, not even from you. But Bilbo made no mistake in choosing his heir, though he little thought how important it would prove. I am afraid you are right. The Ring will not be able to stay hidden in the Shire much longer; and for your own sake, as well as for others, you will have to go, and leave the name of Baggins behind you. That name will not be safe to have, outside the Shire or in the Wild. I will give you a travelling name now. When you go, go as Mr. Underhill.

‘But I don’t think you need go alone. Not if you know of anyone you can trust, and who would be willing to go by your side - and that you would be willing to take into unknown perils. But if you look for a companion, be careful in choosing! And be careful of what you say, even to your closest friends! The enemy has many spies and many ways of hearing.’

Suddenly he stopped as if listening. Frodo became aware that all was very quiet, inside and outside. Gandalf crept to one side of the window. Then with a dart he sprang to the sill, and thrust a long arm out and downwards. There was a squawk, and up came Sam Gamgee’s curly head hauled by one ear.

‘Well, well, bless my beard!’ said Gandalf. ‘Sam Gamgee is it? Now what may you be doing?’

‘Lor bless you, Mr. Gandalf, sir!’ said Sam. ‘Nothing! Leastways I was just trimming the grass-border under the window, if you follow me.’ He picked up his shears and exhibited them as evidence.

‘I don’t,’ said Gandalf grimly. It is some time since I last heard the sound of your shears. How long have you been eavesdropping?’

‘Eavesdropping, sir? I don’t follow you, begging your pardon. There ain’t no eaves at Bag End, and that’s a fact.’

‘Don’t be a fool! What have you heard, and why did you listen?’ Gandalf’s eyes flashed and his brows stuck out like bristles.

‘Mr. Frodo, sir!’ cried Sam quaking. ‘Don’t let him hurt me, sir! Don’t let him turn me into anything unnatural! My old dad would take on so. I meant no harm, on my honour, sir!’

‘He won’t hurt you,’ said Frodo, hardly able to keep from laughing, although he was himself startled and rather puzzled. ‘He knows, as well as I do, that you mean no harm. But just you up and answer his questions straight away!’

‘Well, sir,’ said Sam dithering a little. ‘I heard a deal that I didn’t rightly understand, about an enemy, and rings, and Mr. Bilbo, sir, and dragons, and a fiery mountain, and - and Elves, sir. I listened because I couldn’t help myself, if you know what I mean. Lor bless me, sir, but I do love tales of that sort. And I believe them too, whatever Ted may say. Elves, sir! I would dearly love to see them. Couldn’t you take me to see Elves, sir, when you go?’

Suddenly Gandalf laughed. ‘Come inside!’ he shouted, and putting out both his arms he lifted the astonished Sam, shears, grass-clippings and all, right through the window and stood him on the floor. ‘Take you to see Elves, eh?’ he said, eyeing Sam closely, but with a smile flickering on his face. ‘So you heard that Mr. Frodo is going away?’

‘I did, sir. And that’s why I choked: which you heard seemingly. I tried not to, sir, but it burst out of me: I was so upset.’

‘It can’t be helped, Sam,’ said Frodo sadly. He had suddenly realized that flying from the Shire would mean more painful partings than merely saying farewell to the familiar comforts of Bag End. ‘I shall have to go. But’ - and here he looked hard at Sam - ‘if you really care about me, you will keep that dead secret. See? If you don’t, if you even breathe a word of what you’ve heard here, then I hope Gandalf will turn you into a spotted toad and fill the garden full of grass-snakes.’

Sam fell on his knees, trembling. ‘Get up, Sam!’ said Gandalf. I have thought of something better than that. Something to shut your mouth, and punish you properly for listening. You shall go away with Mr. Frodo!’

‘Me, sir!’ cried Sam, springing up like a dog invited for a walk. ‘Me go and see Elves and all! Hooray!’ he shouted, and then burst into tears.', 'https://www.movieposter.com/posters/archive/main/66/MPW-33283', NULL, 20, 'At the end of the Third Age the part played by the Hobbits in the great events that led to the inclusion of the Shire in the Reunited Kingdom awakened among them a more widespread interest in their own history; and many of their traditions, up to that time still mainly oral, were collected and Written down. The greater families were also concerned with events in the Kingdom at large, and many of their members studied its ancient histories and legends. By the end of the first century of the Fourth Age there were already to be found in the Shire several libraries that contained many historical books and records.

The largest of these collections were probably at Undertowers, at Great Smials, and at Brandy Hall. This account of the end of the Third Age is drawn mainly from the Red Book of Westmarch. That most important source for the history of the War of the Ring was so called because it was long preserved at Undertowers, the home of the Fairbairns, Wardens of the Westmarch. It was in origin Bilbo''s private diary, which he took with him to Rivendell. Frodo brought it back to the Shire, together with many loose leaves of notes, and during S.R. 1420-1 he nearly filled its pages with his account of the War. But annexed to it and preserved with it, probably m a single red case, were the three large volumes, bound in red leather, that Bilbo gave to him as a parting gift. To these four volumes there was added in Westmarch a fifth containing commentaries, genealogies, and various other matter concerning the hobbit members of the Fellowship.

The original Red Book has not been preserved, but many copies were made, especially of the first volume, for the use of the descendants of the children of Master Samwise. The most important copy, however, has a different history. It was kept at Great Smials, but it was written in Condor, probably at the request of the great-grandson of Peregrin, and completed in S.R. 1592 (F.A. 172). Its southern scribe appended this note: Findegil, King''s Writer, finished this work in IV 172. It is an exact copy in all details of the Thain''s Book m Minas Tirith. That book was a copy, made at the request of King Elessar, of the Red Book of the Periannath, and was brought to him by the Thain Peregrin when he retired to Gondor in IV 64.

The Thain''s Book was thus the first copy made of the Red Book and contained much that was later omitted or lost. In Minas Tirith it received much annotation, and many corrections, especially of names, words, and quotations in the Elvish languages; and there was added to it an abbreviated version of those parts of The Tale of Aragorn and Arwen which lie outside the account of the War. The full tale is stated to have been written by Barahir, grandson of the Steward Faramir, some time after the passing of the King. But the chief importance of Findegil''s copy is that it alone contains the whole of Bilbo''s ''Translations from the Elvish''. These three volumes were found to be a work of great skill and learning in which, between 1403 and 1418, he had used all the sources available to him in Rivendell, both living and written. But since they were little used by Frodo, being almost entirely concerned with the Elder Days, no more is said of them here.

Since Meriadoc and Peregrin became the heads of their great families, and at the same time kept up their connexions with Rohan and Gondor, the libraries at Bucklebury and Tuckborough contained much that did not appear in the Red Book. In Brandy Hall there were many works dealing with Eriador and the history of Rohan. Some of these were composed or begun by Meriadoc himself, though in the Shire he was chiefly remembered for his Herblore of the Shire, and for his Reckoning of Years m which he discussed the relation of the calendars of the Shire and Bree to those of Rivendell, Gondor, and Rohan. He also wrote a short treatise on Old Words and Names in the Shire, having special interest in discovering the kinship with the language of the Rohirrim of such ''shire-words'' as mathom and old elements in place names.

At Great Smials the books were of less interest to Shire-folk, though more important for larger history. None of them was written by Peregrin, but he and his successors collected many manuscripts written by scribes of Gondor: mainly copies or summaries of histories or legends relating to Elendil and his heirs. Only here in the Shire were to be found extensive materials for the history of Númenor and the arising of Sauron. It was probably at Great Smials that The Tale of Years was put together, with the assistance of material collected by Meriadoc. Though the dates given are often conjectural, especially for the Second Age, they deserve attention. It is probable that Meriadoc obtained assistance and information from Rivendell, which he visited more than once. There, though Elrond had departed, his sons long remained, together with some of the High-elven folk. It is said that Celeborn went to dwell there after the departure of Galadriel; but there is no record of the day when at last he sought the Grey Havens, and with him went the last living memory of the Elder Days in Middle-earth.');

Графин токайского
 

Лира и ее альм крались вдоль стены парадной обеденной залы, стараясь, чтобы их не заметили из кухни.

Три стоявших в ряд гигантских стола уже накрыли к ужину, и в полумраке тускло поблескивали серебро и хрусталь. Для удобства гостей слуги заботливо отодвинули тяжелые дубовые скамьи. По стенам залы, почти теряясь во мраке, висели портреты предшественников нынешнего магистра.

Стараясь не скрипеть половицами, Лира добралась наконец до невысокого подиума, метнула настороженный взгляд в сторону кухни и, увидев, что в дверях никого нет, на цыпочках приблизилась к стоявшему на возвышении почетному столу. Ножи и вилки здесь были не из серебра, а из чистого золота, и гостей поджидали не дубовые скамьи, а четырнадцать резных кресел красного дерева с бархатной обивкой.

Подойдя к креслу магистра, Лира легонько щелкнула ногтем по хрустальному бокалу. Раздался чистый, нежный звон.

– Ты что творишь! – негодующе прошелестел альм. – Тише!

Пантелеймон, а именно так звался Лирин альм, сейчас был в обличье бражника, и его бурые крылышки почти растворялись в сумраке полутемной залы.

– Ничего я не творю, – буркнула Лира в ответ. – Какая разница? Они там, в кухне, так гремят кастрюлями, что все равно ничего не услышат. А лакей явится только со звонком. Кого бояться‑то?

Однако она проворно накрыла ладошкой хрустальный бокал, и звон затих. Взмахнув крылышками, Пантелеймон сквозь приоткрытую дверь впорхнул в рекреацию, а мгновение спустя уже снова был рядом с Лирой.

– Все чисто. Давай шевелись!

Пригибая голову к коленкам, Лира стрелой прошмыгнула вдоль стола, юркнула в дверь рекреации и застыла как вкопанная посередине комнаты.

Внутри было темно, но в камине жарко пылали поленья, то и дело взметывая вверх огненные снопы искр.

Лира прожила в колледже всю свою коротенькую жизнь, но никогда еще ей не приходилось переступать порог рекреации. Да и немудрено. Входить сюда могли только профессора, да их гости, причем, заметьте, гости исключительно мужского пола. Женщины внутрь не допускались. Даже пыль вытирать здесь должны были не горничные, а дворецкий. Он, и никто другой.

Пантелеймон опустился на Лирино плечико.

– Ну что, довольна? Нагляделась? Пошли отсюда!

– Еще чего! Мы же только пришли! Я хочу посмотре‑е‑е‑ть.

В центре комнаты блестел полированной столешницей розового дерева огромный овальный стол, на котором красовались хрустальные графины с вином и бокалы. Там же примостились серебряная мельничка для табачного листа и целая батарея курительных трубок. На буфетной полке ждали своего часа жаровня и корзинка с маковыми головками.

– А неплохо они тут устроились, а, Пан? – прищелкнула языком Лира.

Она опустилась в обитое зеленой кожей кресло и почти утонула в нем, – таким оно оказалось глубоким. Ухватившись обеими руками за подлокотники, Лира выпрямилась, залезла в кресло с ногами и огляделась по сторонам. С портретов на нее с явным неодобрением взирали ученые мужи – почтенные бородатые старцы, облаченные в профессорские мантии.

– А интересно, о чем они тут разгова… – Лира осеклась на полуслове, поскольку за дверью раздались голоса.
– Говорил же я! Давай за кресло, живо! – выдохнул Пантелеймон, и послушная Лира с быстротой молнии скрылась за креслом. Правда, “скрылась” – это сильно сказано. Кресло стояло посередине комнаты, так что Лира просто притаилась за его спинкой, сжавшись в комочек.

Дверь отворилась, и комнату залил яркий свет. Один из вошедших держал в руках лампу. Из своего укрытия Лира видела только его ноги в темно‑зеленых брюках да начищенные до блеска кожаные башмаки. Кто же это? Наверное, кто‑нибудь из слуг. Вот он прошел через всю комнату и поставил лампу на боковой столик.

Низкий голос прорезал тишину:

– Лорд Азриел уже прибыл, Рен?

Это был голос магистра. Лира сидела ни жива ни мертва от страха. Альм дворецкого (собака, как у всех слуг) дробной рысцой протрусил через комнату и послушно улегся у ног Рена.

А вот наконец и сам магистр, вернее, его ноги в стоптанных черных туфлях, которые ни с чем не спутаешь.

– Никак нет, ваша милость, – ответил дворецкий. – И из аердока тоже никаких известий.

– Как только он приедет, проводите его в обеденную залу. Он, вероятно, будет голоден с дороги.

– Слушаюсь.

– Вы приготовили для него токайское?

– Как вы изволили приказать, урожая тысяча восемьсот девяносто восьмого года. Помнится, это его слабость.

– Отлично. Я вас более не задерживаю.

– Прикажете оставить лампу здесь?

– Да, разумеется. И во время ужина зайдите еще разок поправить фитиль.

– Слушаюсь.

Дворецкий почтительно поклонился и вышел; его альм потрусил следом. Из своего ненадежного укрытия Лира видела, как магистр подошел к высокому дубовому гардеробу, стоявшему в углу комнаты, достал из него магистерскую мантию и, не торопясь, облачился в нее. Он двигался по‑стариковски медленно и словно бы с усилием, ведь лет ему было немало, за семьдесят, хотя на вид и не скажешь. Ворона, альм магистра, примостилась на дверце гардероба и терпеливо ждала, когда процедура облачения закончится. Вот она тяжело слетела вниз и устроилась у старика на правом плече.

Лира чувствовала, что Пантелеймон, хоть он и молчит, весь напрягся, как туго натянутая струна. Сама же она просто умирала от любопытства. Дело в том, что лорд Азриел, о котором магистр говорил дворецкому, приходился нашей Лире родным дядей. И дядю этого она в равной степени обожала и боялась. Занимался он чем‑то ужасно важным и ужасно непонятным: какой‑то “большой политикой”, какими‑то сверхсекретными экспедициями, чуть ли даже не войной, только где‑то очень далеко, на краю света. Так что Лира никогда не знала, расставаясь с дядей, когда им доведется свидеться вновь. Значит, сегодня. Вот и всыплет же он ей, если поймает ее здесь. Ну и пусть всыплет. Не привыкать.

“Как‑нибудь переживу. В первый раз, что ли?” – пронеслось у Лиры в мыслях.

Как вдруг…

Как вдруг она увидела нечто такое, что разом поставило все с ног на голову.

Магистр достал из кармана маленький бумажный пакетик и положил его на край стола. Затем он с трудом вытащил притертую пробку из графина, наполненного золотистым вином, развернул пакетик и тонкой струйкой всыпал в вино какой‑то белый порошок. Достав из кармана карандаш, он тщательно перемешал содержимое и, убедившись, что порошок полностью растворился, закупорил узкое горлышко графина пробкой.

Альм‑ворона хрипло каркнула. Магистр что‑то прогудел ей в ответ, метнул настороженный взгляд из‑под тяжелых набрякших век и вышел, притворив за собой дверь.

– Пан, ты видел, видел? – выдохнула Лира.

– Ой, да все я видел. Быстро… Уходим, пока лакей не вернулся.

Не успел он договорить, как из обеденной залы позвонили.

– Все, – упавшим голосом произнесла Лира.
Не успел он договорить, как из обеденной залы позвонили.

– Все, – упавшим голосом произнесла Лира. – Это звонок к ужину. Что‑то я со временем не рассчитала.

Верный Пантелеймон в мгновение ока произвел разведку на местности.

– Там уже полно лакеев, – сообщил он, вернувшись из залы. – Может, через другую дверь? Нет, туда тоже нельзя.

Другая дверь, которой, кстати, воспользовался магистр, выходила в коридор между библиотекой и преподавательской. Именно в это время там толпится весь колледж: кому‑то надо мантию взять, кому‑то бумаги оставить, не идти же с ними к ужину.

Можно было бы рискнуть и затеряться в толпе ученых мужей. Можно было бы ретироваться через столовую. Ну, подумаешь, попадешься под руку кому‑нибудь из лакеев. Ну наорут. Большое дело! Но из‑за этого белого порошка, который магистр всыпал в графин с вином, мысли в голове у бедной Лиры совсем разбрелись, так что она решительно не знала, что делать.

За дверью раздались шаги. Это лакей. Хочет проверить, все ли в порядке. По традиции после ужина профессора собираются в рекреации, чтобы насладиться бокалом доброго вина и жареным маком.

Лира сломя голову бросилась к стоявшему в углу гардеробу и скользнула внутрь, едва успев прикрыть за собой дверцу. За Пантелеймона она не боялась. Стены в комнате темные, да и кто заметит бражника? Ну, в крайнем случае, залетит под кресло.

В комнате стояла тишина, только слышно было, как сопит лакей. Сквозь щелочку между дверцами Лира увидела, как он поровнее разложил курительные трубки и придирчиво осмотрел батарею графинов и бокалов на столе. Затем он обеими руками пригладил волосы и что‑то негромко сказал своему альму. У всех слуг альмы были собаками. Но этот слуга был не просто лакей, а обер‑лакей, так что альмом его была не просто какая‑то там шавка с хвостом, а гончая. И гончая эта что‑то явно учуяла, но, к великому облегчению Лиры, к гардеробу не подошла. А попадись девочка обер‑лакею – ей несдобровать, ведь он уже дважды так колотил ее!

Вдруг Лира услышала где‑то возле своего плеча шепоток. А, да это Пантелеймон! Проскользнул‑таки за ней следом!

– Все. Пиши пропало. Теперь будем здесь сидеть. Ведь говорил же я тебе! Ну почему ты меня никогда не слушаешь, скажи на милость!

Лира дождалась, пока обер‑лакей выйдет, ведь ему пора было прислуживать за магистерским столом. Из обеденной залы доносился гул голосов; слышно было, как там собирается народ.

– Да, не послушалась и правильно сделала, – зашипела она в ответ, как только за лакеем закрылась дверь. – Иначе мы бы ничего не узнали. Ты что, не понимаешь? Ведь магистр всыпал в графин с вином яд. Пан, миленький, это то самое токайское, про которое он говорил дворецкому. Они же хотят отравить лорда Азриела!

– А может, никакой это не яд?

– Как это не яд? Конечно яд! А зачем же тогда магистр специально дожидался, пока дворецкий уйдет, и только потом подсыпал порошок? Если бы это был не яд, он бы спокойно всыпал его и при дворецком. Не‑е‑ет, все это неспроста. Я чувствую. Тут пахнет политикой. Не зря слуги без конца шепчутся об этом по углам, я же не глухая! Ой, Пан, а вдруг мы предотвратим злодейство?

– Вздор! – отозвался Пан неожиданно резко. – Ты хочешь сказать, что собираешься четыре часа кряду просидеть в этом гробу? Вот так, скорчившись? Послушай меня: я слетаю посмотрю, как там, в коридоре, а когда будет чисто, скажу тебе, ладно?

Бражник с готовностью вспорхнул с Лириного плеча. В узкой полоске света был четко виден его силуэт.

– Нет, Пан, не ладно, – твердо сказала девочка. – Никуда я отсюда не уйду. Я должна, должна понять, что они затевают. И никакой это не гроб. Вон смотри, тут какая‑то мантия висит. Ее можно подстелить под себя, и будет мягко.
Все это время Лира сидела на корточках. Теперь она осторожно выпрямилась в полный рост и, стараясь не шуметь, попыталась на ощупь определить, что же именно висит в шкафу на распялках. Гардероб, между прочим, оказался куда просторнее, чем она думала. А висели в нем профессорские и докторские мантии, все крытые шелком, а некоторые даже с меховой оторочкой.

– Это что, все одного магистра? – изумленно прошептала Лира. – Куда ему столько? Разве у одного человека может быть так много мантий? А‑а, знаю, наверное, когда его приглашают в какой‑нибудь другой университет и избирают там почетным доктором, то в придачу к диплому дают какую‑нибудь красивую накидушку. Вот он привозит ее сюда, вешает в шкаф и потом наряжается, да? Слушай‑ка, Пан, а может, это все‑таки не яд, ты как думаешь?

– Я думаю, что это яд. И еще я думаю, что не нашего все это ума дело. И еще я думаю, что самая большая глупость, которую ты можешь сделать, а понаделала ты их, к слову сказать, немало, так это ввязаться в историю, которая к тебе, Лире, никакого отношения не имеет.

– То есть как это не имеет? – возмутилась Лира. – Не могу же я вот так, за здорово живешь, сидеть и смотреть, как они травят моего дядю?

– Не можешь – не смотри, кто тебя неволит? Уйди куда‑нибудь.

– Эх, Пан, сдрейфил, да?

– Да, сдрейфил, и не боюсь в этом признаться. Скажи‑ка мне, что ты собираешься делать? Что? Как выскочишь, как выпрыгнешь из шкафа и метким ударом ноги выбьешь стакан с ядом из его слабеющих рук? Очень красиво, нечего сказать.

– Ничего подобного я делать не собираюсь, – отчеканила Лира. – Заметь, тебе это известно лучше, чем кому бы то ни было. Пойми, пожалуйста, Пан, ведь после того, что я видела, у меня выбора нет. Ты когда‑нибудь про совесть слышал? Знаешь, что это за штука такая? Сам посуди: могу я сидеть себе где‑нибудь в библиотеке, болтать ногами и знать при этом, что здесь в эту самую минуту творится? Поверь, я же не нарочно. Я не хотела.

Пан помолчал немного, подумал и сказал:

– А вот и врешь. Именно, что хотела. Ты всегда мечтала пробраться сюда, спрятаться и подглядеть. Как же я раньше‑то не догадался!

– Хорошо. Да, я всегда этого хотела. Да, мне интересно. Ведь все же знают, что они тут что‑то делают. Тайны у них какие‑то, посвящения. Что, посмотреть нельзя?

– Нельзя. Потому что нас это не касается. Хочется им играть в прятки – пусть играют. Ты выше должна быть, понимаешь? Выше. А не подслушивать и не прятаться тут по шкафам, как дитя малое.

– Ой‑ой‑ой, какие мы важные, какие мы взрослые! Хватит меня отчитывать, я не маленькая!

Какое‑то время Лира и альм молчали, при этом Лира ерзала на жестких досках, путаясь в полах мантии, а исполненный праведного гнева Пантелеймон сидел у одной из этих мантий на воротнике и оскорбленно поводил усиками.

Казалось, все мысли в голове у Лиры сбились в пестрый беспорядочный клубок. Эх, поговорить бы с Паном, все, глядишь, и встало бы на свои места. Ну уж нет. Первой мириться – ни за что! Ничего не поделаешь, попробуем разобраться сами.

Итак, что же ее сильнее всего тревожит? Страх. А за кого? Ведь не за себя же. Она так часто попадала во всякие дурацкие передряги, что за себя уже давно не боялась. Разучилась. Значит, страх за лорда Азриела. Зачем он приезжает? Он и так‑то в колледже редкий гость, а уж сейчас, со всей этой политической неразберихой…

Не станет же такой занятой человек приезжать, только чтобы выпить‑закусить да трубочку выкурить со старинными приятелями. Нет, что‑то непохоже. Правда, и лорд Азриел, и магистр были членами какого‑то Правительственного Совета. Про Совет этот Лира знала, что они что‑то там такое советуют премьер‑министру. Но тогда заседания этого Совета должны проходить во дворце, а уж никак не в рекреации колледжа Вод Иорданских.
Ничего не понятно. Все последние дни слуги шушукались, что тартары захватили Московию и рвутся на север, к Санкт‑Петербургу. Санкт‑Петербург – ключ к могуществу над Балтией и всей Западной Европой. А куда ездил лорд Азриел? Куда‑то на Север. В Лапландию, что ли. Когда они виделись в последний раз, он собирался в экспедицию.

– Пан, а Пан, – позвала Лира.

– Что?

– А как ты думаешь, только честно, война будет?

– Сейчас – нет. Иначе стал бы лорд Азриел приезжать сюда с визитом! Так что на этой неделе войны не будет.

– И я так думаю. А потом?

– Ш‑ш‑ш.. Сюда идут.

Лира приникла к щелочке между дверцами шкафа. В рекреацию вошел дворецкий, чтобы, как велел магистр, подправить у лампы фитиль. Дело в том, что и в преподавательской, и в библиотеке уже давно пользовались современными яндарическими лампами, но здесь, в рекреации, по‑прежнему зажигали лигроиновые, свет которых был мягче и приятнее глазу. Здесь магистр не потерпел бы никаких нововведений.

Дворецкий поправил фитиль, подбросил в камин еще одно полено и, воровато оглянувшись на дверь, зачерпнул пригоршню табаку из мельнички. Не успел он приладить на место крышечку, как на двери, ведущей в коридор, щелкнул, отворяясь, замок. К восторгу Лиры, дворецкий подпрыгнул, как ужаленный, проворно сунул табак в карман и повернулся навстречу гостю.

– Мое почтение, лорд Азриел, – произнес он с поклоном.

Лира почувствовала, как по спине у нее пробежал холодок. Настал великий миг! Из ее укрытия двери в коридор видно не было, и ей стоило великого труда сидеть тихо и не высовываться.

– А, это вы, Рен, – раздался хрипловатый низкий голос лорда Азриела, всегда отзывавшийся в душе Лиры каким‑то смешанным чувством ужаса и восторга. – Ну, к ужину я, надо полагать, опоздал, так что обожду здесь.

Дворецкий растерянно покрутил головой. Как правило, гости получали доступ в рекреацию только по личному приглашению магистра, и лорд Азриел не знать об этом просто не мог. Однако, заметив пристальный взгляд его милости, устремленный на подозрительно оттопыренный карман ливреи, где лежал краденый табачок, верный слуга благоразумно решил сделать, как велено.

– Прикажете доложить их милости магистру, что вы прибыли?

– Да, пожалуй. И насчет кофе распорядитесь.

– Слушаюсь, милорд.

Дворецкий почтительно поклонился и вышел. Альм потрусил за ним по пятам. Лорд Азриел подошел к камину, передернул плечами и с наслаждением потянулся всем своим длинным телом, облаченным в дорожное платье. Ни дать ни взять проснувшийся лев! Как всегда при виде дядюшки, Лира затрепетала. Все. Теперь и речи не может быть о том, чтобы как‑нибудь выползти из шкафа. Придется сидеть и ждать. Авось пронесет.

Альм лорда Азриела, снежно‑белая пума, потерлась об его ноги.

– Здесь будешь показывать?.. – промурлыкала она.

– Наверное. Это удобнее, чем в лекционном зале. Потом еще разговоров не оберешься. К слову сказать, они ведь захотят на образцы взглянуть. Надо приказать, чтобы кофры занесли сюда… Плохо дело, Стельмария. Что же нам с тобой делать, а? Вот‑вот жди беды.

– Тебе бы отдохнуть. Ты сядь.

Лорд Азриел рухнул в кресло. Теперь Лира не видела его лица, потому что он сидел к ней спиной.

– Отдохнуть – это хорошо. Да и переодеться не мешало бы. У них тут с этим строго. Штрафанут меня на дюжину бургундского за неподобающий вид, а? Отдохнуть… Будь моя воля, я бы проспал трое суток, не меньше. Так ведь…

В дверь постучали, и в рекреацию вновь вошел дворецкий с серебряным кофейным прибором на подносе.

– Благодарю вас, Рен, – улыбнулся лорд Азриел. – А что это за графин на столе? Токайское? Мое любимое?

Во время длительного путешествия Азриэла магистр колледжа отдаёт Лиру на воспитание миссис Колтер, которая увозит девочку в Лондон. Когда Лира понимает, что миссис Колтер не та, за кого себя выдаёт, Лира пытается бежать. Она попадает к бродячим цыганам, которые приглядывали за ней с самого начала. Дальше её путь лежит на Север, куда цыгане отправляют отряд с целью спасти детей, похищенных со всей Англии страшными «жрецами». Там Лира знакомится с ведьмами, бронированными медведями и узнаёт о планах лорда Азриэла. Также ей предстоит узнать, что её родители не погибли. Благодаря помощи ледяного медведя по имени Йорек, девочка добирается до крепости Больвангар, где «жрецы» спрятали похищенных детей.

      Эндер [искаженное имя Эндрю, а также существительное, означающее приблизительно "тот, кто заканчивает", "финалист"] кивнул. Это была ложь, конечно, про "ни капельки". Поскольку взрослые врали так всякий раз, когда собирались сделать ему по-настоящему больно, он нисколько не сомневался в том, что будет. Иногда ложь говорила больше, чем правда. 
      - Так что ты, Эндер, просто подойди и сядь вот сюда, на стол для осмотра. Доктор выйдет к тебе через минуту. 
      Нет монитора. Эндер попробовал представить, что на его шее нет маленького записывающего устройства.

      Но Эндер знал, что Питер все равно не оставит его в покое. Было что-то в глазах Питера, когда на него находило это сумасшедшее настроение... И, вспоминая этот взгляд, этот блеск, Эндер знал единственное, чего Питер не сделает, так это не оставит его в покос. "Я учусь играть на пианино Эндер. Пойдем, будешь переворачивать мне страницы. А-а, мальчик с монитором слишком занят, чтобы помочь своему брату? Он что, слишком умный? Нет, нет. Я не хочу твоей помощи. Я прекрасно справлюсь сам, ты, маленький ублюдок, ты, маленький Третий". 
      - Это недолго, Эндрю, - сказал доктор. 
      Эндер кивнул. 
      - Его сделали так, чтобы можно было снимать. Не калеча, не внося инфекцию. Но будет щекотно, и некоторые люди говорят, что у них бывает такое чувство, будто что-то пропало. Ты все ищешь что-то, очень хочешь найти, но не можешь и уже не помнишь даже, что потерял. Так я скажу тебе: ты ищешь монитор. И его уже нет. А через несколько дней это чувство пройдет. 
      Доктор выкручивал что-то на затылке Эндера. И вдруг боль, как раскаленная игла, пронзила его от шеи до паха. Эндер почувствовал, как судорога сводит спину, как тело резко выгибается назад, - и ударился головой о стол. Он чувствовал, что ноги его бьются в воздухе, а руки сцеплены и до боли выкручивают друг друга. 
      - Диди! - позвал доктор. - Ты мне нужна! 
      Задыхаясь, вбежала сестра. 
      - Нужно как-то расслабить мышцы. Ко мне, быстро! Да чего же ты ждешь! 
      Они что-то делали - Эндер не видел что. Он рванулся в сторону и свалился со стола. 
      - Ловите! - крикнула сестра. 
      - Ты только удержи его... 
      - Держите его сами, доктор, он слишком силен... 
      - Да не сразу! У него же сердце остановится! 
      Эндер ощутил, как в шею, чуть выше воротника рубашки, вошла игла. Лекарство жгло, но всюду, куда доходил этот огонь, сведенные мышцы постепенно расслаблялись. Теперь он мог заплакать от боли и страха. 
      - Эндрю, ты в порядке? - спросила сестра. 
      Эндрю не мог говорить и не помнил, как это делается. Его снова положили на стол, проверяли пульс, делали еще что-то - он ничего не понимал. Руки доктора тряслись. Когда он заговорил, его голос тоже дрожал. 
      - Они заставляют ребенка носить эту штуку три года - так чего они ждут? Мы могли просто выключить его, ты понимаешь? Просто выключить. Навсегда отсоединить его мозг. 
      - Сколько будет действовать наркотик? - спросила сестра. 
      - Мальчик должен лежать здесь по меньшей мере час. Смотри за ним. Если через пятнадцать минут он все еще не сможет говорить, позовешь меня. Мы ведь на самом деле могли отключить его. Я не жукер, я не могу предусмотреть все. 


      Он вернулся в класс к мисс Пэмфри за пятнадцать минут до звонка с урока. Он все еще не очень твердо держался на ногах. 
      - Ты хорошо себя чувствуешь, Эндрю? - спросила мисс Пэмфри. 
      Он кивнул. 
      - Тебе было плохо? 
      Он покачал головой. 
      - Выглядишь ты неважно. 
      - Я в порядке. 
      - Тебе лучше сесть, Эндрю. 
      Он пошел к своему месту, но остановился. А что он, собственно, ищет? Он никак не мог вспомнить. 
      - Твое место вон там, - подсказала мисс Пэмфри. 
      Мальчик сел, но ему нужно было что-то еще, он что-то потерял. Ладно, отыщет потом. 
      - Твой монитор, - прошептала девочка за его спиной. 
      Эндера передернуло. 
      - Его монитор, - шепнула она остальным. 
      Эндер поднял руку и ощупал шею. Там был пластырь. И больше ничего. Монитора нет. Теперь он такой, как все. 
      - Тебя выперли, Эндер? - спросил мальчик, который сидел чуть впереди в соседнем ряду. 
      Он не мог вспомнить его имя. Питер. Нет, это кто-то другой. 
      - Тише, мистер Стилсон, - сказала мисс Пэмфри. 
      Стилсон ухмыльнулся. 
      Мисс Пэмфри говорила об умножении. Эндер баловался со своей партой: рисовал контуры гористых островов, а затем приказывал парте выдать трехмерное изображение - во всех ракурсах. Учительница, наверное, заметит, что он совсем не слушает ее, по не станет его беспокоить. Он всегда знал ответ, даже в тех случаях, когда ей казалось, что он не слышал ее. 
      В углу парты появилось слово и, маршируя, двинулось по периметру экрана. Сначала оно было перевернуто и написано справа налево, но Эндер сумел прочесть его, прежде чем оно добралось до нижнего края экрана и встало, как положено: "Третий". 
      Эндер улыбнулся Это он придумал, как посылать сообщения с экрана на экран и заставлять их маршировать, и этот метод очень нравился ему, даже когда тайные враги пользовались им, чтобы обзываться. Он не виноват, что родился Третьим. Идея принадлежала правительству, это они дали официальное разрешение - иначе как бы Третий вроде Эндера попал в школу? А теперь у него не было монитора. Эксперимент с кодовым названием "Эндрю Виггин" провалился. Мальчик был уверен, что они отменили бы постановление, разрешившее ему появиться на свет, если бы могли. Эксперимент провалился - сотрите файл. 
      Прозвенел звонок. Ребята захлопывали парты или лихорадочно допечатывали себе напоминания на следующий день. Кто-то переписывал задания в свои домашние компьютеры. Парочка крутилась у принтера, ожидая, что машина отпечатает то, что им хотелось бы показать. Эндер протянул руки над маленькой детской клавиатурой у края парты и подумал, а каково это - иметь большие руки, как у взрослого. Они должны быть такими неуклюжими, с толстыми неловкими пальцами, мясистыми ладонями. Конечно, у взрослых и клавиатура побольше, но как могут их толстые пальцы провести правильную линию, какая получалась у Эндера, - тонкую точную линию, спираль в семьдесят девять витков от центра до края парты, и чтобы ни один завиток не перекрывал другого. Да, ему было чем заняться, пока учительница болтала про свою арифметику. Арифметика! Валентина научила его арифметике, когда ему было три года. 
      - У тебя все в порядке, Эндрю? 
      - Да, мэм. 
      - Ты опоздаешь на автобус. 
      Эндер кивнул и встал. 
      Все ребята уже ушли. Но его будут ждать те, плохие. На его шее уже не было монитора, который видел то, что он вплел, и слышал то, что он слышал. Теперь они могут говорить, что хотят. Могут даже ударить его - их больше никто не увидит, а значит, никто не придет на помощь Эндеру. У монитора были свои преимущества, ему будет их не хватать. 
      Конечно, заводилой оказался Стилсон. Он был не крупнее большинства ребят, но больше Эндера. И его окружали другие. Он никогда не ходил один. 
      - Эй, Третий. 
      "Не отвечай. Тебе нечего сказать". 
      - Эй, Третий, мы к тебе обращаемся. Третий, любитель жукеров, с тобой разговаривают. 
      "Не могу придумать ответа. Что бы я ни сказал, это разозлит их еще больше. Ничего не скажу". 
      - Эй, Третий, эй, сморкач, тебя вышибли оттуда, да? Думал, ты лучше нас, но потерял свою маленькую птичку, а получил пластырь на шею. 
      - Вы собираетесь пропустить меня? - спросил Эндер. 
      - Мы собираемся пропустить его? Мы что, должны пропустить его? - Они просто покатывались со смеху. - Да, конечно, мы тебя пропустим. Сначала мы пропустим кусок руки, потом задницу, потом, наверное, колено. 
      Остальные распевали: 
      - Потерял свою пташку, Третий, потерял свою милашку, Третий. 
      Стилсон толкнул Эндера одной рукой, а потом кто-то сзади пихнул его навстречу Стилсону. 
      - Лети, лети, птичка, - сказал кто-то. 
      - Теннис. 
      - Пинг-понг. 
      Эта затея добром не кончится. И Эндер решил, что будет лучше, если самым несчастным окажется не он, и, когда Стилсон протянул руку, чтобы снова его толкнуть, попытался схватить противника. Но промахнулся. 
      - Ух ты! Ты что, хочешь драться со мной? Хочешь драться, Тройка несчастная? 
      Стоявшие сзади кинулись на Эндера, чтобы удержать его, и схватили за плечи. 
      Эндеру было вовсе не до смеха, но он все же рассмеялся: 
      - Тебе нужно столько помощников, чтобы побить одного Третьего? 
      - Мы люди, а не третьи, жабья рожа. У тебя не хватит силы даже пукнуть по-настоящему. 
      Все-таки они отпустили его. И в ту же минуту Эндер высоко вскинул руку и ударил что было сил. Он попал Стилсону прямо в грудь. Тот упал. Эндер даже растерялся, так как не рассчитывал сбить противника с ног одним ударом. Ему не пришло в голову, что тот не принял драку всерьез и не был готов к настоящему отчаянному удару. 
      На мгновение остальные расступились. Стилсон лежал не двигаясь, и его дружки гадали, не умер ли он. А Эндер лихорадочно соображал, как предотвратить их месть. Они ведь встретят его завтра всей бандой. 
      "Я должен победить сейчас - раз и навсегда. Или придется драться с ними каждый день, и тогда мне не поздоровится". 
      Эндер в спои шесть лет знал неписаные законы ведения войны, знал, как должен вести себя мужчина. Нельзя бить беспомощного, лежащего на земле. Так поступают только звери. 
      Но все же он подошел к неподвижному противнику и ударил его снова, ногой под ребра. Стилсон застонал и откатился в сторону. Эндер снова подошел и снова ударил его ногой - в промежность. Теперь Стилсон не мог даже стонать, он свернулся клубком, слезы градом катились из его глаз. 
      Эндер холодно оглядел остальных. 
      - Собираетесь напасть все разом? Вместе вы, наверное, здорово меня побьете. Но вы должны помнить, как я поступаю с людьми, которые пытаются сделать мне больно. После того как вы меня побьете, вам останется только гадать, как именно я доберусь до каждого из вас и что из этого выйдет. - Он пнул Стилсона в лицо. - Это будет не так, - сказал он. - Это будет хуже. 
      Эндер повернулся и пошел. Никто не преследовал его. Он свернул за угол, в коридор, ведущий к автобусной остановке, успев при этом услышать, как мальчишки говорят за его спиной: 
      - Черт, ты посмотри, он весь белый. 
      Победитель прижался лицом к стене коридора и плакал, пока не пришел автобус. 
      "Я совсем как Питер. Стоило забрать у меня монитор, и я стал совсем как Питер". 


2. ПИТЕР


      - Все. Отработали. Как его дела? 
      - Когда живешь в чьем-то теле несколько лет, привыкаешь к нему. Теперь я смотрю на его лицо и не понимаю, что происходит там, внутри. Я не могу распознать его чувства по выражению лица, я привык ощущать их. 
      - Кончай, мы здесь не о психоанализе толкуем. Мы солдаты, а не экстрасенсы. Ты только что видел, как он вышиб дух из вожака этой шайки. 
      - Очень обстоятельно. Он не просто побил его, он его разбил. Как Мэйзер Ракхейм во... 
      - Знаю, знаю. То есть, по мнению комитета, он нам подходит. 
      - В основном. Надо еще посмотреть, как он поступит со своим братом теперь, когда у него нет монитора. 
      - С братом? А ты не боишься того, что его брат может сделать с ним? 
      - Ты сам говорил мне, что в этом деле мы не имеем права рисковать. 
      - Я снова просмотрел несколько старых записей. Ничего не могу с собой поделать - мне нравится этот парень. Боюсь, мы искалечим его. 
      - Конечно. Это и есть наша работа. Мы жестокие колдуны. Мы обещаем детишкам печенье, а потом едим их живьем. 


      - Мне очень жаль, Эндер, - прошептала Валентина. 
      Она осматривала пластырь на его шее. 
      Эндер легко коснулся стены, и дверь бесшумно закрылась за его спиной. 
      - Ерунда. Я рад, что его больше нет. 
      - Чего нет? - Питер вышел в прихожую, дожевывая кусок хлеба с ореховым маслом. 
      Для Эндера Питер не был высоким, красивым десятилетним мальчиком, каким его видели взрослые, мальчиком с густыми темными спутанными волосами и лицом, которое могло бы принадлежать Александру Великому. Эндер смотрел на Питера только для того, чтобы вовремя заметить злобу или скуку - опасные настроения, которые почти всегда означали для него боль. Как только Питер увидел пластырь, в глазах его вспыхнул яростный огонек. 
      Валентина тоже заметила это. 
      - Теперь он такой, как мы, - сказала она, пытаясь смягчить брата, прежде чем он ударит. 
      Но Питера уже нельзя было смягчить. 
      - Как мы? Он таскал эту коробку до шести лет. Когда у тебя забрали твою? В три. Я потерял свою, прежде чем мне исполнилось пять. Он почти добился успеха, маленький ублюдок, маленький жукер. 
      "Вес в порядке, - подумал Эндер. - Говори, Питер, говори. От слов нет вреда". 
      - Ну, теперь-то твои ангелы-хранители не следят за тобой, - сказал Питер. - Больше они не будут проверять, больно ли тебе, не подслушают, что я говорю, не увидят, что я с тобой делаю. Ну, что ты думаешь об этом? 
      Эндер пожал плечами. 
      Вдруг Питер улыбнулся и хлопнул в ладоши, изображая хорошее настроение. 
      - Давай поиграем в жукеров и астронавтов, - предложил он. 
      - Где мама? - спросила Валентина. 
      - Ушла, - сообщил Питер. - Я за старшего. 
      - Пожалуй, я позову папу. 
      - Зови. Ты же знаешь, его никогда нет дома. 
      - Я сыграю, - согласился Эндер. 
      - Ты будешь жукером, - предупредил Питер. 
      - Дай ему хоть раз побыть астронавтом, - попросила Валентина. 
      - Держи свою толстую рожу подальше, пукалка, - огрызнулся Питер. - А ты иди наверх и выбери оружие. 
      Это будет нехорошая игра, Эндер знал. И выиграть ему не удастся. Когда дети играли в коридорах большими компаниями, жукеры никогда не выигрывали, причем порой игра становилась жестокой. Но здесь, в квартире, она будет жестокой с самого начала, а жукер не мог исчезнуть, раствориться в воздухе, как это делали настоящие жукеры в настоящих войнах. Ему оставалось только ждать, пока астронавт не закончит игру. 
      Питер открыл нижний ящик своего шкафа и вытащил маску жукера. Мама очень расстроилась, когда Питер купил ее. Но папа сказал, что война не прекратится от того, что мы спрячем маски жукеров и запретим детям стрелять из игрушечных лазерных ружей. Лучше пусть тренируются в своих военных играх, тогда, может быть, они сумеют выжить, когда жукеры вернутся. 
      "Если я переживу эти игры", - подумал Эндер и надел маску. Она сомкнулась, как будто ладонь прижали к лицу. "Но ведь жукеры чувствуют себя иначе, - подумал Эндер. - Они не носят маски, у них просто такие лица. Интересно, дома, в своих мирах, они надевают маски людей, чтобы поиграть? А как они называют нас? Слизняками, потому что по сравнению с ними мы такие мягкие и маслянистые?" 
      - Берегись, слизняк! - крикнул Эндер. 
      Он едва видел Питера через дырки для глаз. 
      - Слизняк, да? - улыбнулся Питер. - Ну, жукер-мукер, сейчас посмотрим, как я разобью твою рожу. 
      Эндер не видел атаки, только понял, что Питер куда-то отошел. Маска лишила его периферийного обзора. Вдруг появилась боль - его резко ударили по голове, сбоку. Он потерял равновесие и упал. 
      - Плохо видишь, да, жукер? - смеялся Питер. 
      Эндер начал стаскивать маску. Питер поставил ногу на его пах. 
      - Не снимай, - приказал он. 
      Эндер снова натянул маску и убрал руки. 
      Питер надавил. Боль пронзила Эндера насквозь, и он согнулся пополам. 
      - Лежи ровно, жукер. Я собираюсь вивисектировать тебя. Наконец мы взяли одного из вас живым и теперь хотим узнать, как вы устроены. 
      - Питер, перестань, - попросил Эндер. 
      - "Питер, перестань". Очень хорошо. Значит, вы, жукеры, умеете угадывать наши имена. Вы можете разговаривать, как милые несчастные маленькие дети, хотите, чтобы мы полюбили вас и обращались с вами хорошо. Но это не сработает. Я знаю, кто ты такой на самом деле. Они хотели, чтобы ты был человеком, маленький Третий, но на самом деле ты жукер, теперь это видно всем. 
      Он убрал ногу, шагнул вперед и наклонился над братом, уперся коленом ему в живот как раз под ребрами и начал давить всем телом, сильнее и сильнее. Эндеру стало трудно дышать. 
      - Я могу убить тебя так, - прошептал Питер. - Просто давить и давить, пока ты не умрешь. А потом прикинусь, что не знал, больно ли тебе, что мы просто играли, и мне поверят, и все будет в порядке. А ты умрешь. Да, все будет в порядке. 
      Эндер не мог говорить: в легких почти не было воздуха. Питер способен на это. Возможно, сейчас он шутит, но когда-нибудь захочет сделать это всерьез. 
      - Я так и сделаю, - пообещал Питер. - Что бы ты там ни думал, сделаю. Тебя разрешили только потому, что я им понравился. Но я не подошел. А ты был лучше. Они думали, что ты лучше. Но мне не нужен младший брат, который лучше меня. Я не хочу Третьего. 
      - Я расскажу, - вмешалась Валентина. 
      - Никто тебе не поверит. 
      - Поверят. 
      - Тогда ты тоже мертва, моя миленькая маленькая сестренка. 
      - О да, - усмехнулась Валентина. - Они поверят этому. "Я не знал, что это убьет Эндрю. Он умер, но я не подумал, что это убьет и Валентину". 
      Давление уменьшилось. 
      - Хорошо. Не сегодня. Когда-нибудь вы не будете вместе. И тогда произойдет несчастный случай. 
      - Врешь! - крикнула Валентина. - Ты вовсе не собираешься ничего такого делать! 
      - Не собираюсь? 
      - И знаешь почему? - спросила она. - Ты мечтаешь со временем войти в правительство и хочешь, чтобы тебя избрали. А тебя не изберут, если твои противники откопают, что твои брат и сестра погибли от подозрительного несчастного случая, когда были совсем маленькими. А они откопают, потому что я написала письмо и оставила в секретном файле, который распечатают в случае моей смерти. 
      - Зачем этот дешевый блеф? - спросил Питер. 
      - Там сказано: я умерла не естественной смертью. Питер убил меня, и если он еще не убил Эндрю, то скоро сделает это. Этого недостаточно для судебного приговора, но хватит для провала на выборах. 
      - Теперь ты его монитор, - предупредил Питер. - Хорошенько следи за ним днем и ночью. А еще лучше - никогда не оставляй его одного. 
      - Мы с Эндером не дураки. И знаем все не хуже тебя. А кое что даже и лучше. Мы страшно умные и толковые дети. Ты не самый умный из нас, Питер, ты просто самый большой. 
      - Ох, я знаю. Но придет день, когда ты забудешь - и он останется один. И вдруг ты вспомнишь, кинешься к нему, а он тут как тут, целый и невредимый. В следующий раз ты уже не будешь так беспокоиться и прибежишь не так быстро. И каждый раз он будет жив и здоров. И тогда ты подумаешь, что забыл я. Пройдут годы. А потом произойдет ужасный несчастный случай, и я найду его тело и буду горько рыдать над ним. Ты вспомнишь этот наш разговор, Вэлли, но тут же устыдишься, ибо будешь уверена, что я изменился, что это на самом деле несчастный случай и что жестоко напоминать мне слова, которые я сгоряча выпалил однажды в детской ссоре. Только это будет неправда. Я сделаю это, и он умрет, а ты не помешаешь мне. Продолжай верить, что я просто самый большой. 
      - Какое же ты дерьмо, - поморщилась Валентина. 
      Питер вскочил на ноги и прыгнул на нее. Она увернулась. Эндер сорвал маску. Питер шлепнулся на свою кровать и захохотал. Громко, но с настоящим чувством, слезы брызнули у него из глаз. 
      - Ну, вы, ребята, какие же вы олухи, самые большие простаки на этой планете. 
      - Сейчас он скажет, что просто пошутил, - пожала плечами Валентина. 
      - Это не шутка - игра. Я могу заставить вас, ребята, поверить во что угодно. Могу управлять вами, как марионетками. - Голосом сказочного чудовища он прорычал: - Я разрублю вас на мелкие кусочки и выброшу их в мусорную яму! - Он снова засмеялся. - Самые большие простаки во всей Солнечной системе. 
      Эндер стоял, смотрел, как он смеется, и думал о Стилсоне, о том чувстве, которое сам испытывал, избивая врага. Вот кому следовало бы врезать так же. Он явно этого заслуживал. 
      Будто читая его мысли, Валентина прошептала: 
      - Нет, Эндер. 
      Питер вдруг перекатился на бок, слетел с кровати и встал в стойку. 
      - О да, Эндер, - сказал он. - В любое время, Эндер. 
      Эндер поднял правую ногу, снял ботинок, перевернул его. 
      - Посмотри сюда, на носок. Это кровь, Питер. 
      - Ох-ох! Я сейчас умру. Эндер убил гусеницу и теперь собирается убить меня. 
      Ничто не могло его пронять. Питер был убийцей в душе, и никто не знал об этом, кроме Валентины и Эндера. 
      Мать вернулась домой и вместе с Эндером поплакала над потерей монитора. Отец пришел домой и все повторял, какой это прекрасный сюрприз - у них такие замечательные дети, что правительство разрешило им иметь сразу троих, а теперь, после всего, не хочет никого забирать, так что их остается трое, они могут оставить Третьего... Эндер с трудом сдерживался, чтобы не закричать на него. "Я знаю, что я Третий, я знаю, если хотите, я уйду, чтобы вам не было так неловко перед всеми, мне жаль, что я потерял монитор и теперь у вас трое детей и нет очевидного объяснения - такое неудобство, - мне очень жаль, жаль, жаль". 
      Он лежал на кровати и смотрел вверх, в темноту. Он слышал, как на кровати над ним беспокойно ворочается Питер. Потом Питер соскользнул со своего второго этажа и вышел из комнаты. Эндер уловил журчащий звук сливаемой воды, потом силуэт Питера появился в дверном проеме. 
      "Он думает, что я сплю. Он хочет убить меня". 
      Питер подошел к кровати и, конечно, не стал залезать на свою. Вместо этого он сделал еще шаг и остановился около Эндера. 
      Но он не потянулся за подушкой, чтобы задушить брата. И у него не было оружия. 
      Он прошептал: 
      - Эндер, извини, мне очень жаль. Я знаю, каково это, мне правда жаль, я твой брат, я люблю тебя. 
      Много позже ровное дыхание Питера показало, что он спит. Эндер сорвал с шеи пластырь. И - во второй раз за этот день - заплакал.

The Shade howled in rage and stalked forward, flinging his sword at a tree. It passed halfway through the trunk, where it stuck, quivering. He shot nine bolts of energy from his palm—which killed the Urgals instantly—then ripped his sword free and strode to the elf.

Prophecies of revenge, spoken in a wretched language only he knew, rolled from his tongue. He clenched his thin hands and glared at the sky. The cold stars stared back, unwinking, otherworldly watchers. Disgust curled his lip before he turned back to the unconscious elf.

Her beauty, which would have entranced any mortal man, held no charm for him. He confirmed that the stone was gone, then retrieved his horse from its hiding place among the trees. After tying the elf onto the saddle, he mounted the charger and made his way out of the woods.

He quenched the fires in his path but left the rest to burn.

DISCOVERY

Eragon knelt in a bed of trampled reed grass and scanned the tracks with a practiced eye. The prints told him that the deer had been in the meadow only a half-hour before. Soon they would bed down. His target, a small doe with a pronounced limp in her left forefoot, was still with the herd. He was amazed she had made it so far without a wolf or bear catching her.

The sky was clear and dark, and a slight breeze stirred the air. A silvery cloud drifted over the mountains that surrounded him, its edges glowing with ruddy light cast from the harvest moon cradled between two peaks. Streams flowed down the mountains from stolid glaciers and glistening snowpacks. A brooding mist crept along the valley’s floor, almost thick enough to obscure his feet.

Eragon was fifteen, less than a year from manhood. Dark eyebrows rested above his intense brown eyes. His clothes were worn from work. A hunting knife with a bone handle was sheathed at his belt, and a buckskin tube protected his yew bow from the mist. He carried a wood-frame pack.

The deer had led him deep into the Spine, a range of untamed mountains that extended up and down the land of Alagaësia. Strange tales and men often came from those mountains, usually boding ill. Despite that, Eragon did not fear the Spine—he was the only hunter near Carvahall who dared track game deep into its craggy recesses.

It was the third night of the hunt, and his food was half gone. If he did not fell the doe, he would be forced to return home empty-handed. His family needed the meat for the rapidly approaching winter and could not afford to buy it in Carvahall.

Eragon stood with quiet assurance in the dusky moonlight, then strode into the forest toward a glen where he was sure the deer would rest. The trees blocked the sky from view and cast feathery shadows on the ground. He looked at the tracks only occasionally; he knew the way.

At the glen, he strung his bow with a sure touch, then drew three arrows and nocked one, holding the others in his left hand. The moonlight revealed twenty or so motionless lumps where the deer lay in the grass. The doe he wanted was at the edge of the herd, her left foreleg stretched out awkwardly.

Eragon slowly crept closer, keeping the bow ready. All his work of the past three days had led to this moment. He took a last steadying breath and—an explosion shattered the night.

The herd bolted. Eragon lunged forward, racing through the grass as a fiery wind surged past his cheek. He slid to a stop and loosed an arrow at the bounding doe. It missed by a finger’s breadth and hissed into darkness. He cursed and spun around, instinctively nocking another arrow.

Behind him, where the deer had been, smoldered a large circle of grass and trees. Many of the pines stood bare of their needles. The grass outside the charring was flattened. A wisp of smoke curled in the air, carrying a burnt smell. In the center of the blast radius lay a polished blue stone. Mist snaked across the scorched area and swirled insubstantial tendrils over the stone.

Eragon watched for danger for several long minutes, but the only thing that moved was the mist. Cautiously, he released the tension from his bow and moved forward. Moonlight cast him in pale shadow as he stopped before the stone. He nudged it with an arrow, then jumped back. Nothing happened, so he warily picked it up.

Nature had never polished a stone as smooth as this one. Its flawless surface was dark blue, except for thin veins of white that spiderwebbed across it. The stone was cool and frictionless under his fingers, like hardened silk. Oval and about a foot long, it weighed several pounds, though it felt lighter than it should have.

Eragon found the stone both beautiful and frightening.Where did it come from? Does it have a purpose? Then a more disturbing thought came to him:Was it sent here by accident, or am I meant to have it? If he had learned anything from the old stories, it was to treat magic, and those who used it, with great caution.

But what should I do with the stone?It would be tiresome to carry, and there was a chance it was dangerous. It might be better to leave it behind. A flicker of indecision ran through him, and he almost dropped it, but something stayed his hand.At the very least, it might pay for some food, he decided with a shrug, tucking the stone into his pack.

The glen was too exposed to make a safe camp, so he slipped back into the forest and spread his bedroll beneath the upturned roots of a fallen tree. After a cold dinner of bread and cheese, he wrapped himself in blankets and fell asleep, pondering what had occurred.

P ALANCARVALLEY

The sun rose the next morning with a glorious conflagration of pink and yellow. The air was fresh, sweet, and very cold. Ice edged the streams, and small pools were completely frozen over. After a breakfast of porridge, Eragon returned to the glen and examined the charred area. The morning light revealed no new details, so he started for home.

The rough game trail was faintly worn and, in places, nonexistent. Because it had been forged by animals, it often backtracked and took long detours. Yet for all its flaws, it was still the fastest way out of the mountains.

The Spine was one of the only places that King Galbatorix could not call his own. Stories were still told about how half his army disappeared after marching into its ancient forest. A cloud of misfortune and bad luck seemed to hang over it. Though the trees grew tall and the sky shone brightly, few people could stay in the Spine for long without suffering an accident. Eragon was one of those few—not through any particular gift, it seemed to him, but because of persistent vigilance and sharp reflexes. He had hiked in the mountains for years, yet he was still wary of them. Every time he thought they had surrendered their secrets, something happened to upset his understanding of them—like the stone’s appearance.
He kept up a brisk pace, and the leagues steadily disappeared. In late evening he arrived at the edge of a precipitous ravine. The Anora River rushed by far below, heading to Palancar Valley. Gorged with hundreds of tiny streams, the river was a brute force, battling against the rocks and boulders that barred its way. A low rumble filled the air.

He camped in a thicket near the ravine and watched the moonrise before going to bed.

It grew colder over the next day and a half. Eragon traveled quickly and saw little of the wary wildlife. A bit past noon, he heard the Igualda Falls blanketing everything with the dull sound of a thousand splashes. The trail led him onto a moist slate outcropping, which the river sped past, flinging itself into empty air and down mossy cliffs.

Before him lay Palancar Valley, exposed like an unrolled map. The base of the Igualda Falls, more than a half-mile below, was the northernmost point of the valley. A little ways from the falls was Carvahall, a cluster of brown buildings. White smoke rose from the chimneys, defiant of the wilderness around it. At this height, farms were small square patches no bigger than the end of his finger. The land around them was tan or sandy, where dead grass swayed in the wind. The Anora River wound from the falls toward Palancar’s southern end, reflecting great strips of sunlight. Far in the distance it flowed past the village Therinsford and the lonely mountain Utgard. Beyond that, he knew only that it turned north and ran to the sea.

After a pause, Eragon left the outcropping and started down the trail, grimacing at the descent. When he arrived at the bottom, soft dusk was creeping over everything, blurring colors and shapes into gray masses. Carvahall’s lights shimmered nearby in the twilight; the houses cast long shadows. Aside from Therinsford, Carvahall was the only village in Palancar Valley. The settlement was secluded and surrounded by harsh, beautiful land. Few traveled here except merchants and trappers.

The village was composed of stout log buildings with low roofs—some thatched, others shingled. Smoke billowed from the chimneys, giving the air a woody smell. The buildings had wide porches where people gathered to talk and conduct business. Occasionally a window brightened as a candle or lamp was lit. Eragon heard men talking loudly in the evening air while wives scurried to fetch their husbands, scolding them for being late.

Eragon wove his way between the houses to the butcher’s shop, a broad, thick-beamed building. Overhead, the chimney belched black smoke.

He pushed the door open. The spacious room was warm and well lit by a fire snapping in a stone fireplace. A bare counter stretched across the far side of the room. The floor was strewn with loose straw. Everything was scrupulously clean, as if the owner spent his leisure time digging in obscure crannies for minuscule pieces of filth. Behind the counter stood the butcher Sloan. A small man, he wore a cotton shirt and a long, bloodstained smock. An impressive array of knives swung from his belt. He had a sallow, pockmarked face, and his black eyes were suspicious. He polished the counter with a ragged cloth.

Sloan’s mouth twisted as Eragon entered. “Well, the mighty hunter joins the rest of us mortals. How many did you bag this time?”

“None,” was Eragon’s curt reply. He had never liked Sloan. The butcher always treated him with disdain, as if he were something unclean. A widower, Sloan seemed to care for only one person—his daughter, Katrina, on whom he doted.

“I’m amazed,” said Sloan with affected astonishment. He turned his back on Eragon to scrape something off the wall. “And that’s your reason for coming here?”

“Yes,” admitted Eragon uncomfortably.

“If that’s the case, let’s see your money.” Sloan tapped his fingers when Eragon shifted his feet and remained silent. “Come on—either you have it or you don’t. Which is it?”

“I don’t really have any money, but I do—”

“What, no money?” the butcher cut him off sharply. “And you expect to buy meat! Are the other merchants giving away their wares? Should I just hand you the goods without charge? Besides,” he said abruptly, “it’s late. Come back tomorrow with money. I’m closed for the day.”

Eragon glared at him. “I can’t wait until tomorrow, Sloan. It’ll be worth your while, though; I found something to pay you with.” He pulled out the stone with a flourish and set it gently on the scarred counter, where it gleamed with light from the dancing flames.

“Stole it is more likely,” muttered Sloan, leaning forward with an interested expression.

Ignoring the comment, Eragon asked, “Will this be enough?”

Sloan picked up the stone and gauged its weight speculatively. He ran his hands over its smoothness and inspected the white veins. With a calculating look, he set it down. “It’s pretty, but how much is it worth?”

“I don’t know,” admitted Eragon, “but no one would have gone to the trouble of shaping it unless it had some value.”

“Obviously,” said Sloan with exaggerated patience. “But how much value? Since you don’t know, I suggest that you find a trader who does, or take my offer of three crowns.”

“That’s a miser’s bargain! It must be worth at least ten times that,” protested Eragon. Three crowns would not even buy enough meat to last a week.

Sloan shrugged. “If you don’t like my offer, wait until the traders arrive. Either way, I’m tired of this conversation.”

The traders were a nomadic group of merchants and entertainers who visited Carvahall every spring and winter. They bought whatever excess the villagers and local farmers had managed to grow or make, and sold what they needed to live through another year: seeds, animals, fabric, and supplies like salt and sugar.

But Eragon did not want to wait until they arrived; it could be a while, and his family needed the meat now. “Fine, I accept,” he snapped.

“Good, I’ll get you the meat. Not that it matters, but where did you find this?”

“Two nights ago in the Spine—”

“Get out!” demanded Sloan, pushing the stone away. He stomped furiously to the end of the counter and started scrubbing old bloodstains off a knife.

“Why?” asked Eragon. He drew the stone closer, as if to protect it from Sloan’s wrath.

“I won’t deal with anything you bring back from those damned mountains! Take your sorcerer’s stone elsewhere.” Sloan’s hand suddenly slipped and he cut a finger on the knife, but he seemed not to notice. He continued to scrub, staining the blade with fresh blood.
Yes! Unless you pay with coins,” Sloan growled, and hefted the knife, sidling away. “Go, before I make you!”

The door behind them slammed open. Eragon whirled around, ready for more trouble. In stomped Horst, a hulking man. Sloan’s daughter, Katrina—a tall girl of sixteen—trailed behind him with a determined expression. Eragon was surprised to see her; she usually absented herself from any arguments involving her father. Sloan glanced at them warily, then started to accuse Eragon. “He won’t—”

“Quiet,” announced Horst in a rumbling voice, cracking his knuckles at the same time. He was Carvahall’s smith, as his thick neck and scarred leather apron attested. His powerful arms were bare to the elbow; a great expanse of hairy muscular chest was visible through the top of his shirt. A black beard, carelessly trimmed, roiled and knotted like his jaw muscles. “Sloan, what have you done now?”

“Nothing.” He gave Eragon a murderous gaze, then spat, “This . . .boy came in here and started badgering me. I asked him to leave, but he won’t budge. I even threatened him and he still ignored me!” Sloan seemed to shrink as he looked at Horst.

“Is this true?” demanded the smith.

“No!” replied Eragon. “I offered this stone as payment for some meat, and he accepted it. When I told him that I’d found it in the Spine, he refused to even touch it. What difference does it make where it came from?”

Horst looked at the stone curiously, then returned his attention to the butcher. “Why won’t you trade with him, Sloan? I’ve no love for the Spine myself, but if it’s a question of the stone’s worth, I’ll back it with my own money.”

The question hung in the air for a moment. Then Sloan licked his lips and said, “This is my own store. I can do whatever I want.”

Katrina stepped out from behind Horst and tossed back her auburn hair like a spray of molten copper. “Father, Eragonis willing to pay. Give him the meat, and then we can have supper.”

Sloan’s eyes narrowed dangerously. “Go back to the house; this is none of your business. . . . I saidgo !” Katrina’s face hardened, then she marched out of the room with a stiff back.

Eragon watched with disapproval but dared not interfere. Horst tugged at his beard before saying reproachfully, “Fine, you can deal with me. What were you going to get, Eragon?” His voice reverberated through the room.

“As much as I could.”

Horst pulled out a purse and counted out a pile of coins. “Give me your best roasts and steaks. Make sure that it’s enough to fill Eragon’s pack.” The butcher hesitated, his gaze darting between Horst and Eragon. “Not selling to me would be a very bad idea,” stated Horst.

Glowering venomously, Sloan slipped into the back room. A frenzy of chopping, wrapping, and low cursing reached them. After several uncomfortable minutes, he returned with an armful of wrapped meat. His face was expressionless as he accepted Horst’s money, then proceeded to clean his knife, pretending that they were not there.

Horst scooped up the meat and walked outside. Eragon hurried behind him, carrying his pack and the stone. The crisp night air rolled over their faces, refreshing after the stuffy shop.

“Thank you, Horst. Uncle Garrow will be pleased.”

Horst laughed quietly. “Don’t thank me. I’ve wanted to do that for a long time. Sloan’s a vicious troublemaker; it does him good to be humbled. Katrina heard what was happening and ran to fetch me. Good thing I came—the two of you were almost at blows. Unfortunately, I doubt he’ll serve you or any of your family the next time you go in there, even if you do have coins.”

“Why did he explode like that? We’ve never been friendly, but he’s always taken our money. And I’ve never seen him treat Katrina that way,” said Eragon, opening the top of the pack.

Horst shrugged. “Ask your uncle. He knows more about it than I do.”

Eragon stuffed the meat into his pack. “Well, now I have one more reason to hurry home . . . to solve this mystery. Here, this is rightfully yours.” He proffered the stone.

Horst chuckled. “No, you keep your strange rock. As for payment, Albriech plans to leave for Feinster next spring. He wants to become a master smith, and I’m going to need an assistant. You can come and work off the debt on your spare days.”

Eragon bowed slightly, delighted. Horst had two sons, Albriech and Baldor, both of whom worked in his forge. Taking one’s place was a generous offer. “Again, thank you! I look forward to working with you.” He was glad that there was a way for him to pay Horst. His uncle would never accept charity. Then Eragon remembered what his cousin had told him before he had left on the hunt. “Roran wanted me to give Katrina a message, but since I can’t, can you get it to her?”

“Of course.”

“He wants her to know that he’ll come into town as soon as the merchants arrive and that he will see her then.”

“That all?”

Eragon was slightly embarrassed. “No, he also wants her to know that she is the most beautiful girl he has ever seen and that he thinks of nothing else.”

Horst’s face broke into a broad grin, and he winked at Eragon. “Getting serious, isn’t he?”

“Yes, sir,” Eragon answered with a quick smile. “Could you also give her my thanks? It was nice of her to stand up to her father for me. I hope that she isn’t punished because of it. Roran would be furious if I got her into trouble.”

“I wouldn’t worry about it. Sloan doesn’t know that she called me, so I doubt he’ll be too hard on her. Before you go, will you sup with us?”

“I’m sorry, but I can’t. Garrow is expecting me,” said Eragon, tying off the top of the pack. He hoisted it onto his back and started down the road, raising his hand in farewell.

The meat slowed him down, but he was eager to be home, and renewed vigor filled his steps. The village ended abruptly, and he left its warm lights behind. The pearlescent moon peeked over the mountains, bathing the land in a ghostly reflection of daylight. Everything looked bleached and flat.

Near the end of his journey, he turned off the road, which continued south. A simple path led straight through waist-high grass and up a knoll, almost hidden by the shadows of protective elm trees. He crested the hill and saw a gentle light shining from his home.', 'https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/k0AEqMS1HY4m36hbdpdTyRcpZur.jpg', NULL, 20, 'Wind howled through the night, carrying a scent that would change the world. A tall Shade lifted his head and sniffed the air. He looked human except for his crimson hair and maroon eyes.

He blinked in surprise. The message had been correct: they were here. Or was it a trap? He weighed the odds, then said icily, “Spread out; hide behind trees and bushes. Stop whoever is coming . . . or die.”

Around him shuffled twelve Urgals with short swords and round iron shields painted with black symbols. They resembled men with bowed legs and thick, brutish arms made for crushing. A pair of twisted horns grew above their small ears. The monsters hurried into the brush, grunting as they hid. Soon the rustling quieted and the forest was silent again.

The Shade peered around a thick tree and looked up the trail. It was too dark for any human to see, but for him the faint moonlight was like sunshine streaming between the trees; every detail was clear and sharp to his searching gaze. He remained unnaturally quiet, a long pale sword in his hand. A wire-thin scratch curved down the blade. The weapon was thin enough to slip between a pair of ribs, yet stout enough to hack through the hardest armor.

The Urgals could not see as well as the Shade; they groped like blind beggars, fumbling with their weapons. An owl screeched, cutting through the silence. No one relaxed until the bird flew past. Then the monsters shivered in the cold night; one snapped a twig with his heavy boot. The Shade hissed in anger, and the Urgals shrank back, motionless. He suppressed his distaste—they smelled like fetid meat—and turned away. They were tools, nothing more.');
